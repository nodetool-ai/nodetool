## 2026-02-17 - Optimizing Log Subscriptions with Zustand
**Learning:** Zustand's default selector equality is strict equality (`===`). If a selector returns a new reference (like `array.filter()` does), the component will re-render on EVERY store update, even if the data content is identical. This is O(N) re-renders for N components.
**Action:** Use `useStoreWithEqualityFn` (from `zustand/traditional`) with `shallow` equality (from `zustand/shallow`) when selecting derived arrays or objects to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
