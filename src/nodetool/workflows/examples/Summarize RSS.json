Other reports said one tram was reversing at the time.\nA spokesman for the prefecture said an investigation into the cause of the accident has been opened and no fatalities have been confirmed.\n\nStrasbourg's mayor Jeanne Barseghian told reporters at the scene there had been a collision involving a tram, but the cause was not known.\nAccording to BFM TV, Barseghian called on people to wait for the results of the investigation.\nOne eyewitness named Johan told AFP news agency that he saw one of the trams reversing at speed, adding: \"We heard a big impact, a big bang.\"\nAnother eyewitness told BFM TV that the doors of the tram flew off on impact.\nThe outlet reported that a large security perimeter was set up in front of the station.\nThe Bas-Rhin region's Fire and Rescue Service posted on X urging people to avoid the area to allow emergency services to access the area.\nThe service's director Rene Cellier said some of the non-fatal injuries reported were \"mostly trauma\", but also include scalp wounds, clavicle fractures, and knee sprains.\n\"There are also around 100 people who have no particular injuries but are being seen by the doctors,\" Cellier said.\nHe added that around 50 vehicles and 130 firefighters were dispatched to the scene and that the situation \"could have been much more serious\".\nEmmanuel Auneau, the director of the CTS - which is responsible for managing public transport in Strasbourg - said the two tram drivers were \"not physically injured, but are very shocked\".\n\nAlso in EuropeGermany says Russian 'shadow' ship stuck in Baltic Sea\n\n'My father should die in prison', daughter of Dominique Pelicot tells BBC\n\nTrump wants to take Greenland: Four ways this saga could go\n\nEurope\nFrance\nStrasbourg\n\nRelated\n\nGermany says Russian 'shadow' ship stuck in Baltic Sea\n\n10 hrs ago\nEurope\n\nMusk interviews German far-right frontwoman\n\n2 days ago\nEurope\n\nJailed Belarus opposition figure seen for first time in months\n\n3 days ago\nEurope\n\nMore\n\n1 day ago\n\n'My father should die in prison', daughter of Dominique Pelicot tells BBC\n\nCaroline Darian has become a vocal advocate for victims of sexual violence in the wake of her mother's trial.\n1 day ago\nEurope\n\n3 days ago\n\nWas Deschamps right to leave and will Zidane replace him?\n\nBBC French football expert Julien Laurens discusses Didier Deschamps decision to stand down as France coach and says Zinedine Zidane is primed to replace him.\n3 days ago\nFrance\n\n4 days ago\n\nFrance's Nicolas Sarkozy: 'Bling' and legal woes\n\nThe former president- already twice convicted- is standing trial for accepting cash from late Libyan dictator Gaddafi.\n4 days ago\nEurope\n\n4 days ago\n\nGermany and France warn Trump over threat to take over Greenland\n\nThe EU's two leading members were reacting to the US president-elect's plans to acquire Denmark's autonomous territory.\n4 days ago\nWorld\n\n4 days ago\n\nFrance manager Deschamps to step down after 2026 World Cup\n\nFrance's World Cup-winning manager Didier Deschamps says he will step down after the 2026 tournament in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n4 days ago\nFrance\n\nBritish Broadcasting Corporation\n\nHome\n\nNews\n\nSport\n\nBusiness\n\nInnovation\n\nCulture\n\nArts\n\nTravel\n\nEarth\n\nVideo\n\nLive\n\nAudio\n\nWeather\n\nBBC Shop\n\nBBC in other languages\n\nFollow BBC on:\n\nTerms of Use\n\nAbout the BBC\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookies\n\nAccessibility Help\n\nContact the BBC\n\nAdvertise with us\n\nDo not share or sell my info\n\nContact technical support\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Three tugboats took control of the \"stricken vessel\" that is \"unable to manoeuvre\".\nMaritime authorities said on Friday night that no oil leaks had been detected.\nIn its latest update on Saturday evening, German maritime authorities said the towing convoy around the tanker was headed to Sassnitz, a town on the island of R\u00fcgen, and would arrive early on Sunday.\nEarlier, authorities said the convoy of tugboats working to rescue Eventin remained north of R\u00fcgen and was moving eastwards \"slowly\", at about 2.5 km per hour (1.5mph).\nCCME said they had taken safety measures given the rough seas, as the area where the vessel is located was experiencing 2.5m-high (8ft) waves and strengthening wind gusts.\n\nHavariekommando\n\nThe oil tanker was drifting at a low speed in the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea\n\nAlthough the vessel sports the Panamanian flag, German authorities have blamed Russia for the incident.\n\"Russia is endangering our European security not only with its illegal war of aggression against Ukraine, but also with severed cables, displaced border buoys, disinformation campaigns, GPS jammers and, as we have seen, dilapidated oil tankers,\" the German foreign minister said in a statement.\nLast December, the European Union said it was working on measures including sanctions to target \"Russia's shadow fleet, which threatens security and the environment, while funding Russia's war budget\".\nThe European bloc's remarks came after undersea cables in the Baltic Sea were damaged by a suspected vessel, which the EU believes was part of Russia's shadow fleet.\nThe move was a further step taken by Western countries to hit the Kremlin's oil industry in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \nSince tougher embargo measures were put in place to halt Russia from exporting oil, Moscow is believed to be using ships with unclear ownership to transport goods - namely oil - across the globe.\nAs reported by the Atlantic Council, a US-based think tank, Russia is \"instrumentalising the dark fleet, using it especially as a primary conveyor of oil exports\".\nThe shadow fleet, or dark fleet, is the name given to ageing ships that sail \"without the industry's standard Western insurance, have opaque ownership, frequently change their names and flag registrations, and generally operate outside maritime regulations\", according to the Atlantic Council. \nThe latest incident in the Baltic Sea comes as Washington and London joined efforts to directly sanction energy companies Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas. \nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the move to weaken Russian oil companies would \"drain Russia's war chest,\" adding that funds taken \"from Putin's hands helps save Ukrainian lives\".\nBut Gazprom Neft slammed the sanctions as \"baseless\" and \"illegitimate\", as reported by Russian state news agencies.\nAlso on Friday, the US Department of the Treasury said it had sanctioned 183 vessels that are \"part of the shadow fleet as well as oil tankers owned by Russia-based fleet operators\". \n\nAlso In EuropeDozens injured after Strasbourg tram collision\n\nTrump wants to take Greenland: Four ways this saga could go\n\nUS and UK toughen sanctions on Russian oil industry\n\nEurope\nGermany\nRussia\n\nRelated\n\nDozens injured after Strasbourg tram collision\n\n11 hrs ago\nEurope\n\nMusk interviews German far-right frontwoman\n\n2 days ago\nEurope\n\nJailed Belarus opposition figure seen for first time in months\n\n3 days ago\nEurope\n\nMore\n\n15 hrs ago\n\nUkraine says it captured two injured North Korean soldiers in Russia\n\nPresident Zelensky says the two men are receiving \"necessary medical assistance\". \n15 hrs ago\nWorld\n\n1 day ago\n\nUS and UK toughen sanctions on Russian oil industry\n\nThe actions are aimed at cutting off revenue Moscow is using to fund its war in Ukraine.\n1 day ago\nEurope\n\n2 days ago\n\nTrump says meeting with Putin being arranged\n\nThe US president-elect has said previously that he wants to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.\n2 days ago\nWorld\n\n3 days ago\n\nRussia keeping close eye on Trump's claim to Greenland\n\nThe Kremlin reacts to the US president-elect's remarks saying the Arctic is in Russia's sphere of interest.\n3 days ago\nEurope\n\n4 days ago\n\nRussian shelling kills 13 in Zaporizhzhia - Ukraine\n\nUkraine says Russia deliberately hit the city with guided aerial bombs knowing that civilians will be hurt. \n4 days ago\nEurope\n\nBritish Broadcasting Corporation\n\nHome\n\nNews\n\nSport\n\nBusiness\n\nInnovation\n\nCulture\n\nArts\n\nTravel\n\nEarth\n\nVideo\n\nLive\n\nAudio\n\nWeather\n\nBBC Shop\n\nBBC in other languages\n\nFollow BBC on:\n\nTerms of Use\n\nAbout the BBC\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookies\n\nAccessibility Help\n\nContact the BBC\n\nAdvertise with us\n\nDo not share or sell my info\n\nContact technical support\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

It had been prepared before Trump's remarks but the announcement just hours after them was described by the Danish defence minister as an \"irony of fate\".\n\"What was important in what Trump said was that Denmark has to fulfil its obligations in the Arctic or it's got to let the US do it,\" says Elisabet Svane, chief political correspondent for Politiken newspaper.\nMarc Jacobsen, associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, believes that this is a case of Trump \"positioning himself before entering office\" while Greenland is using the occasion to gain more international authority, as an important step towards independence.\nSo even if Trump were to lose further interest in Greenland now, which Professor Jacobsen thinks is the most likely scenario, he has certainly put the spotlight on the issue.\nBut independence for Greenland has been on the agenda for many years, and some say the debate could even go in the opposite direction.\n\"I noticed in the last few days the Greenland PM is calmer in his comments - ie. yes, we want independence but in the long run,\" says Svane.\n\nReuters\n\nGreenland votes for independence, seeks closer ties with US\n\nThere is a general consensus in Greenland that independence will happen eventually, and also that if Greenland votes for it, Denmark will accept and ratify it. \nHowever, it is also unlikely that Greenland would vote for independence unless its people are given guarantees that they can keep the subsidies they currently get from Denmark to pay for things like healthcare and the welfare system.\n\"The Greenland PM may be up in arms now, but in the event that he actually calls a referendum, he will need some kind of convincing narrative about how to save the Greenland economy and welfare system,\" Ulrik Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, told the BBC.\nOne possible next step is a free association - something like the US currently has with Pacific states the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau.\nDenmark has previously opposed this status both for Greenland and for the Faroe Islands, but according to Dr Gad, current Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is not categorically against it.\n\"Danish understanding of the Greenland historical experience is way better than it was 20 years ago,\" he says, with Denmark accepting colonial responsibility.\nThe recent discussions \"might persuade [Frederiksen] to say - better to keep Denmark in the Arctic, keep some kind of connection to Greenland, even if it's a looser one\", he adds.\nBut even if Greenland is able to get rid of Denmark, it has become clear in recent years that it can't get rid of the US. The Americans never really left after taking control of the island in World War Two, and see it as vital for their security.\nAn agreement in 1951 affirmed Denmark's basic sovereignty of the island but, in effect, gave the US whatever it wanted.\nDr Gad said that Greenland officials had been in contact with the last two US administrations about Washington's role.\n\"They now know the US will never leave,\" he said.\n\nWhy does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?\n\nDanes struggle with response to Trump Greenland threat\n\nRussia keeping close eye on Trump's claim to Greenland\n\nTrump steps up economic pressure\n\nThere has been speculation that Trump's economic rhetoric is potentially the biggest threat to Denmark - with the US drastically increasing tariffs on Danish, or even EU, goods, forcing Denmark into concessions of some kind over Greenland.\nProfessor Jacobsen says Danish governments have been preparing for that, and not just because of the Arctic territory. \nTrump has been threatening universal 10% tariffs on all US imports which could, among other things, significantly disrupt European growth, and some Danish and other European companies are now considering setting up manufacturing bases in the US.\nPossible options for raising tariffs include by invoking the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), Benjamin Cote of international law firm Pillsbury told the website MarketWatch.\nOne of the main Danish industries potentially affected by this is pharmaceuticals. The US receives products such as hearing aids and most of its insulin from Denmark, as well as the diabetes drug Ozempic, made by the Danish company Novo Nordisk.\nAnalysts say the hike in prices that would result from these measures would not find favour with the US public.\n\nTrump invades Greenland\n\nThe \"nuclear option\" seems far-fetched, but with Trump failing to rule out military action it has to be considered.\nEssentially, it wouldn't be hard for the US to take control, given that they already have bases and plenty of troops in Greenland. \n\"The US has de facto control already,\" says Professor Jacobsen, adding that Trump's remarks seemed ill-informed and he didn't understand the point of them.\nThat said, any use of military force by Washington would create an international incident.\n\"If they invade Greenland, they invade Nato,\" says Svane. \"So that's where it stops. Article 5 would have to be triggered. And if a Nato country invades Nato then there's no Nato.\"\nDr Gad says Trump sounds like Chinese President Xi Jinping talking about Taiwan or Russia's Vladimir Putin talking about Ukraine.\n\"He's saying it's legitimate for us to take this piece of land,\" he says. \"If we take him really seriously this is a bad omen for the whole of the Western alliance.\"\nAdditional reporting by George Sandeman\n\nGreenland\nDenmark\nDonald Trump\nUnited States\n\nRelated\n\nGreenland profile\n\n2 days ago\nEurope\n\nDanes struggle with response to Trump Greenland threat\n\n2 days ago\nEurope\n\nRussia keeping close eye on Trump's claim to Greenland\n\n3 days ago\nEurope\n\nMore\n\n2 hrs ago\n\nWhat's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?\n\nEverything you need to know about the blazes that have forced thousands to leave their homes.\n2 hrs ago\nUS & Canada\n\n2 hrs ago\n\n'Everything is gone' - Agony on a tight-knit LA street razed by inferno\n\nLifelong neighbours of West Las Flores Drive banded together, even as their community burned down.\n2 hrs ago\nUS & Canada\n\n2 hrs ago\n\nLA firefighters battle to contain monster inferno as death toll rises\n\nThe Palisades blaze is threatening Brentwood, one of the most affluent enclaves of America's second-biggest city.\n2 hrs ago\nUS & Canada\n\n5 hrs ago\n\nWhat we know about LA fires victims\n\nAn amputee and his bedbound son, and a man trying to defend his home of 55 years are among the 11 victims of the Los Angeles fires.\n5 hrs ago\nUS & Canada\n\n6 hrs ago\n\nThe star player hoping to turn millions of TikTok followers into rugby fans\n\nThe US athlete and social media star helped attract record crowds as she made her English rugby debut.\n6 hrs ago\nEngland\n\nBritish Broadcasting Corporation\n\nHome\n\nNews\n\nSport\n\nBusiness\n\nInnovation\n\nCulture\n\nArts\n\nTravel\n\nEarth\n\nVideo\n\nLive\n\nAudio\n\nWeather\n\nBBC Shop\n\nBBC in other languages\n\nFollow BBC on:\n\nTerms of Use\n\nAbout the BBC\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookies\n\nAccessibility Help\n\nContact the BBC\n\nAdvertise with us\n\nDo not share or sell my info\n\nContact technical support\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Three tugboats took control of the \"stricken vessel\" that is \"unable to manoeuvre\".\nMaritime authorities said on Friday night that no oil leaks had been detected.\nIn its latest update on Saturday evening, German maritime authorities said the towing convoy around the tanker was headed to Sassnitz, a town on the island of R\u00fcgen, and would arrive early on Sunday.\nEarlier, authorities said the convoy of tugboats working to rescue Eventin remained north of R\u00fcgen and was moving eastwards \"slowly\", at about 2.5 km per hour (1.5mph).\nCCME said they had taken safety measures given the rough seas, as the area where the vessel is located was experiencing 2.5m-high (8ft) waves and strengthening wind gusts.\n\nHavariekommando\n\nThe oil tanker was drifting at a low speed in the coastal waters of the Baltic Sea\n\nAlthough the vessel sports the Panamanian flag, German authorities have blamed Russia for the incident.\n\"Russia is endangering our European security not only with its illegal war of aggression against Ukraine, but also with severed cables, displaced border buoys, disinformation campaigns, GPS jammers and, as we have seen, dilapidated oil tankers,\" the German foreign minister said in a statement.\nLast December, the European Union said it was working on measures including sanctions to target \"Russia's shadow fleet, which threatens security and the environment, while funding Russia's war budget\".\nThe European bloc's remarks came after undersea cables in the Baltic Sea were damaged by a suspected vessel, which the EU believes was part of Russia's shadow fleet.\nThe move was a further step taken by Western countries to hit the Kremlin's oil industry in response to Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. \nSince tougher embargo measures were put in place to halt Russia from exporting oil, Moscow is believed to be using ships with unclear ownership to transport goods - namely oil - across the globe.\nAs reported by the Atlantic Council, a US-based think tank, Russia is \"instrumentalising the dark fleet, using it especially as a primary conveyor of oil exports\".\nThe shadow fleet, or dark fleet, is the name given to ageing ships that sail \"without the industry's standard Western insurance, have opaque ownership, frequently change their names and flag registrations, and generally operate outside maritime regulations\", according to the Atlantic Council. \nThe latest incident in the Baltic Sea comes as Washington and London joined efforts to directly sanction energy companies Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas. \nUK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the move to weaken Russian oil companies would \"drain Russia's war chest,\" adding that funds taken \"from Putin's hands helps save Ukrainian lives\".\nBut Gazprom Neft slammed the sanctions as \"baseless\" and \"illegitimate\", as reported by Russian state news agencies.\nAlso on Friday, the US Department of the Treasury said it had sanctioned 183 vessels that are \"part of the shadow fleet as well as oil tankers owned by Russia-based fleet operators\". \n\nAlso In EuropeDozens injured after Strasbourg tram collision\n\nTrump wants to take Greenland: Four ways this saga could go\n\nUS and UK toughen sanctions on Russian oil industry\n\nEurope\nGermany\nRussia\n\nRelated\n\nDozens injured after Strasbourg tram collision\n\n11 hrs ago\nEurope\n\nMusk interviews German far-right frontwoman\n\n2 days ago\nEurope\n\nJailed Belarus opposition figure seen for first time in months\n\n3 days ago\nEurope\n\nMore\n\n15 hrs ago\n\nUkraine says it captured two injured North Korean soldiers in Russia\n\nPresident Zelensky says the two men are receiving \"necessary medical assistance\". \n15 hrs ago\nWorld\n\n1 day ago\n\nUS and UK toughen sanctions on Russian oil industry\n\nThe actions are aimed at cutting off revenue Moscow is using to fund its war in Ukraine.\n1 day ago\nEurope\n\n2 days ago\n\nTrump says meeting with Putin being arranged\n\nThe US president-elect has said previously that he wants to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.\n2 days ago\nWorld\n\n3 days ago\n\nRussia keeping close eye on Trump's claim to Greenland\n\nThe Kremlin reacts to the US president-elect's remarks saying the Arctic is in Russia's sphere of interest.\n3 days ago\nEurope\n\n4 days ago\n\nRussian shelling kills 13 in Zaporizhzhia - Ukraine\n\nUkraine says Russia deliberately hit the city with guided aerial bombs knowing that civilians will be hurt. \n4 days ago\nEurope\n\nBritish Broadcasting Corporation\n\nHome\n\nNews\n\nSport\n\nBusiness\n\nInnovation\n\nCulture\n\nArts\n\nTravel\n\nEarth\n\nVideo\n\nLive\n\nAudio\n\nWeather\n\nBBC Shop\n\nBBC in other languages\n\nFollow BBC on:\n\nTerms of Use\n\nAbout the BBC\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookies\n\nAccessibility Help\n\nContact the BBC\n\nAdvertise with us\n\nDo not share or sell my info\n\nContact technical support\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

It had been prepared before Trump's remarks but the announcement just hours after them was described by the Danish defence minister as an \"irony of fate\".\n\"What was important in what Trump said was that Denmark has to fulfil its obligations in the Arctic or it's got to let the US do it,\" says Elisabet Svane, chief political correspondent for Politiken newspaper.\nMarc Jacobsen, associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, believes that this is a case of Trump \"positioning himself before entering office\" while Greenland is using the occasion to gain more international authority, as an important step towards independence.\nSo even if Trump were to lose further interest in Greenland now, which Professor Jacobsen thinks is the most likely scenario, he has certainly put the spotlight on the issue.\nBut independence for Greenland has been on the agenda for many years, and some say the debate could even go in the opposite direction.\n\"I noticed in the last few days the Greenland PM is calmer in his comments - ie. yes, we want independence but in the long run,\" says Svane.\n\nReuters\n\nGreenland votes for independence, seeks closer ties with US\n\nThere is a general consensus in Greenland that independence will happen eventually, and also that if Greenland votes for it, Denmark will accept and ratify it. \nHowever, it is also unlikely that Greenland would vote for independence unless its people are given guarantees that they can keep the subsidies they currently get from Denmark to pay for things like healthcare and the welfare system.\n\"The Greenland PM may be up in arms now, but in the event that he actually calls a referendum, he will need some kind of convincing narrative about how to save the Greenland economy and welfare system,\" Ulrik Gad, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, told the BBC.\nOne possible next step is a free association - something like the US currently has with Pacific states the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau.\nDenmark has previously opposed this status both for Greenland and for the Faroe Islands, but according to Dr Gad, current Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen is not categorically against it.\n\"Danish understanding of the Greenland historical experience is way better than it was 20 years ago,\" he says, with Denmark accepting colonial responsibility.\nThe recent discussions \"might persuade [Frederiksen] to say - better to keep Denmark in the Arctic, keep some kind of connection to Greenland, even if it's a looser one\", he adds.\nBut even if Greenland is able to get rid of Denmark, it has become clear in recent years that it can't get rid of the US. The Americans never really left after taking control of the island in World War Two, and see it as vital for their security.\nAn agreement in 1951 affirmed Denmark's basic sovereignty of the island but, in effect, gave the US whatever it wanted.\nDr Gad said that Greenland officials had been in contact with the last two US administrations about Washington's role.\n\"They now know the US will never leave,\" he said.\n\nWhy does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?\n\nDanes struggle with response to Trump Greenland threat\n\nRussia keeping close eye on Trump's claim to Greenland\n\nTrump steps up economic pressure\n\nThere has been speculation that Trump's economic rhetoric is potentially the biggest threat to Denmark - with the US drastically increasing tariffs on Danish, or even EU, goods, forcing Denmark into concessions of some kind over Greenland.\nProfessor Jacobsen says Danish governments have been preparing for that, and not just because of the Arctic territory. \nTrump has been threatening universal 10% tariffs on all US imports which could, among other things, significantly disrupt European growth, and some Danish and other European companies are now considering setting up manufacturing bases in the US.\nPossible options for raising tariffs include by invoking the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), Benjamin Cote of international law firm Pillsbury told the website MarketWatch.\nOne of the main Danish industries potentially affected by this is pharmaceuticals. The US receives products such as hearing aids and most of its insulin from Denmark, as well as the diabetes drug Ozempic, made by the Danish company Novo Nordisk.\nAnalysts say the hike in prices that would result from these measures would not find favour with the US public.\n\nTrump invades Greenland\n\nThe \"nuclear option\" seems far-fetched, but with Trump failing to rule out military action it has to be considered.\nEssentially, it wouldn't be hard for the US to take control, given that they already have bases and plenty of troops in Greenland. \n\"The US has de facto control already,\" says Professor Jacobsen, adding that Trump's remarks seemed ill-informed and he didn't understand the point of them.\nThat said, any use of military force by Washington would create an international incident.\n\"If they invade Greenland, they invade Nato,\" says Svane. \"So that's where it stops. Article 5 would have to be triggered. And if a Nato country invades Nato then there's no Nato.\"\nDr Gad says Trump sounds like Chinese President Xi Jinping talking about Taiwan or Russia's Vladimir Putin talking about Ukraine.\n\"He's saying it's legitimate for us to take this piece of land,\" he says. \"If we take him really seriously this is a bad omen for the whole of the Western alliance.\"\nAdditional reporting by George Sandeman\n\nGreenland\nDenmark\nDonald Trump\nUnited States\n\nRelated\n\nGreenland profile\n\n2 days ago\nEurope\n\nDanes struggle with response to Trump Greenland threat\n\n2 days ago\nEurope\n\nRussia keeping close eye on Trump's claim to Greenland\n\n3 days ago\nEurope\n\nMore\n\n2 hrs ago\n\nWhat's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?\n\nEverything you need to know about the blazes that have forced thousands to leave their homes.\n2 hrs ago\nUS & Canada\n\n2 hrs ago\n\n'Everything is gone' - Agony on a tight-knit LA street razed by inferno\n\nLifelong neighbours of West Las Flores Drive banded together, even as their community burned down.\n2 hrs ago\nUS & Canada\n\n2 hrs ago\n\nLA firefighters battle to contain monster inferno as death toll rises\n\nThe Palisades blaze is threatening Brentwood, one of the most affluent enclaves of America's second-biggest city.\n2 hrs ago\nUS & Canada\n\n5 hrs ago\n\nWhat we know about LA fires victims\n\nAn amputee and his bedbound son, and a man trying to defend his home of 55 years are among the 11 victims of the Los Angeles fires.\n5 hrs ago\nUS & Canada\n\n6 hrs ago\n\nThe star player hoping to turn millions of TikTok followers into rugby fans\n\nThe US athlete and social media star helped attract record crowds as she made her English rugby debut.\n6 hrs ago\nEngland\n\nBritish Broadcasting Corporation\n\nHome\n\nNews\n\nSport\n\nBusiness\n\nInnovation\n\nCulture\n\nArts\n\nTravel\n\nEarth\n\nVideo\n\nLive\n\nAudio\n\nWeather\n\nBBC Shop\n\nBBC in other languages\n\nFollow BBC on:\n\nTerms of Use\n\nAbout the BBC\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nCookies\n\nAccessibility Help\n\nContact the BBC\n\nAdvertise with us\n\nDo not share or sell my info\n\nContact technical support\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.
