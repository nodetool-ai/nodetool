    Use Cases
    * A model trained for text generation can be later adapted to follow instructions. One of the most used open-source models for instruction is OpenAssistant, which you can try at Hugging Chat.

    * A Text Generation model, also known as a causal language model, can be trained on code from scratch to help the programmers in their repetitive coding tasks. One of the most popular open-source models for code generation is StarCoder, which can generate code in 80+ languages. You can try it here.

    * A story generation model can receive an input like "Once upon a time" and proceed to create a story-like text based on those first words. You can try this application which contains a model trained on story generation, by MosaicML.
