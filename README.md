# Architecture

# Architecture Overview

NodeTool's architecture is designed for flexibility. Here's a breakdown of the main components:

1. **React Frontend**: The user interface built with React, providing an intuitive way for users to create and manage workflows.

2. **API Server**: Handles HTTP and WebSocket connections from the frontend, managing user sessions, workflow storage, and coordination between components.

3. **WebSocket Runner**: Responsible for executing workflows in real-time, maintaining the state of running workflows, and managing the communication between nodes.

4. **Worker**: Performs the actual processing of individual nodes, allowing for parallel execution and scalability.

## Key Features:

- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket connections enable live updates and interactive workflow execution.
- **Scalable Processing**: The Worker architecture allows for distributed processing of node tasks.
- **Flexible Node System**: Easy integration of new node types and AI services.
- **HTTP Callbacks**: Support for asynchronous operations and integration with external services.

## Data Flow:

1. User interacts with the React Frontend to create or modify workflows.
2. Frontend communicates with the API Server to save workflows and initiate execution.
3. API Server delegates workflow execution to the WebSocket Runner.
4. WebSocket Runner coordinates the execution of individual nodes through Workers.
5. Results are sent back to the Frontend in real-time via WebSocket connections.
6. HTTP Callbacks allow for asynchronous updates and integration with external services.

This architecture enables NodeTool to handle complex AI workflows efficiently, providing a seamless experience for users while maintaining the flexibility to incorporate various AI services and custom nodes.

## Implementing Custom Nodes

Extend NodeTool's functionality by creating custom nodes:

```python
class MyAgent(BaseNode):
    prompt: Field(default="Build me a website for my business.")
    
    async def process(self, context: ProcessingContext) -> str:
        llm = MyLLM()
        return llm.generate(self.prompt)
```

# Development

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- NodeJS 20+

## Run backend

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
./scripts/server
```

## Run frontend

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm start
```

Now, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the NodeTool interface.

## Run Electron App

If you want to run the Electron App, you need to install the dependencies and start the frontend and backend.

```bash
cd electron
npm start
```

## Sync dependencies
Dependencies are managed in `pyproject.toml` and must be synced to `requirements.txt` using:

```
poetry export -f requirements.txt --output requirements.test.txt --without-hashes
```
