### Run without Electron

Ensure you have the Conda environment activated.

On macOS and Linux:

```bash
./scripts/server --with-ui --reload
```

On windows:

```bash
.\scripts\server.bat --with-ui --reload
```

Now, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the NodeTool interface.

### Run with Electron

Ensure you have the Conda environment activated and the location is set in the settings file located at `~/.config/nodetool/settings.yaml` or `%APPDATA%/nodetool/settings.yaml` on Windows:

```yaml
CONDA_ENV: /path/to/conda/environment # e.g. /Users/matthias/miniconda3/envs/nodetool
```

Before running Electron, you need to build the frontends located in the `/web` and `/apps` directories:

```bash
cd web && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
cd apps && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
```

Once the build is complete, you can start the Electron app:

```bash
cd electron
npm install
npm start
```

The Electron app starts the frontend and backend automatically.
