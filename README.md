## ü§ñ NodeTool Agent System

Design sophisticated AI agents capable of handling complex, multi-step tasks using NodeTool's agent framework.

**Core Capabilities:**

- **Strategic Task Planning:** Automatically break down complex objectives into structured, executable plans.
- **Chain of Thought Reasoning:** Enable agents to perform step-by-step problem solving with explicit reasoning paths.
- **Tool Integration:** Equip agents with tools for web browsing, file operations, API calls, and more.
- **Streaming Results:** Get live updates as agents reason and execute tasks.

### Ready-to-Use Agent Examples

NodeTool includes several pre-built agent examples:

- **Wikipedia-Style Research Agent:** Generates structured documentation via web research.
- **ChromaDB Research Agent:** Processes and indexes documents for semantic querying.
- **Social Media Analysis Agents:** Tracks and analyzes content from Twitter/X, Instagram, and Reddit.
- **Professional Research Tools:** Analyzes the LinkedIn job market and performs advanced Google searches.
- **Utility Agents:** Processes emails and integrates web search capabilities.

Find full implementations and more examples in the [examples directory](https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-core/tree/main/examples).

## ‚ú® Cool Things You Can Do

Explore practical examples showcasing NodeTool's capabilities:

- **üìß Daily Email Digest:** Automatically scans your Gmail, summarizes emails using an LLM (extracting sender, topics, actions), and creates a concise daily digest. Stay updated without manually reading every email.
- **üêâ Pokemon Maker:** Generate unique Pokemon descriptions and images using AI. Input animal inspirations and get custom Pokemon with types, abilities, and personalities.
- **üîç Simple RAG Document Q&A:** Ask questions about your documents. This workflow searches a ChromaDB vector collection, formats relevant results, and uses an LLM (like Deepseek-Coder-V2) to generate answers based _only_ on the retrieved content.
- **üé® Image Style Transfer:** Transform images by applying the style of a reference image. Uses IP-Adapter for style and ControlNet for structure preservation, perfect for creative image variations.

## üöÄ Quickstart (Release Info)

Release 0.6 is in pre-release.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

Follow these steps to set up a local development environment.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11:** Required for the backend.
- **Conda:** Download and install from [miniconda.org](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
- **Node.js (Latest LTS):** Required for the frontend. Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en).

### 1. Set Up Conda Environment

```bash
# Create and activate the Conda environment
conda create -n nodetool python=3.11 -y
conda activate nodetool

# Install essential system dependencies via Conda
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg cairo x264 x265 aom libopus libvorbis lame pandoc uv -y
```

### 2. Install Core Python Dependencies

These are the essential packages to run NodeTool.

```bash
# Install nodetool-core and nodetool-base
# On macOS / Linux / Windows:
pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-core
pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-base
```

### 3. Install Optional Node Packs (As Needed)

NodeTool's functionality is extended via packs. Install only the ones you need.

```bash
# List available packs (optional)
nodetool package list -a

# Example: Install packs for specific integrations
pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-ollama          # For Ollama local models
pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-openai          # For OpenAI API
pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-huggingface --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 # For HuggingFace models (PyTorch/CUDA)
pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-chroma          # For ChromaDB vector storage
# ... install other packs like anthropic, google, replicate, fal, comfy, elevenlabs, etc.
# pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-anthropic
# pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-google
# ... add other relevant packs here
```

_Note:_ Some packs like `nodetool-comfy` and `nodetool-huggingface` may require specific PyTorch versions or CUDA drivers. Use the `--extra-index-url` when necessary.

### 4. Run NodeTool Backend & Web UI

Ensure the `nodetool` Conda environment is active.

**Option A: Run Backend with Web UI (for Development)**

This starts the backend server and serves the web UI directly. Hot-reloading is enabled.

```bash
# On macOS and Linux:
./scripts/server

# On Windows:
.\scripts\server.bat
```

Access the UI in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Option B: Run with Electron App**

This provides the full desktop application experience.

**Configure Conda Path:**
Ensure your `settings.yaml` file points to your Conda environment path:

- macOS/Linux: `~/.config/nodetool/settings.yaml`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/nodetool/settings.yaml`

```yaml
CONDA_ENV: /path/to/your/conda/envs/nodetool # e.g., /Users/me/miniconda3/envs/nodetool
```

**Build Frontends:**
You only need to do this once or when frontend code changes.

```bash
# Build the main web UI
cd web
npm install
npm run build
cd ..

# Build the apps UI (if needed)
cd apps
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

**Start Electron:**

```bash
cd electron
npm install
npm start
```

The Electron app will launch, automatically starting the backend and frontend.
