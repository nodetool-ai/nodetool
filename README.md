## ü§ñ NodeTool Agent System

Design sophisticated AI agents capable of handling complex, multi-step tasks using NodeTool's agent framework.

**Core Capabilities:**

- **Strategic Task Planning:** Automatically break down complex objectives into structured, executable plans.
- **Chain of Thought Reasoning:** Enable agents to perform step-by-step problem solving with explicit reasoning paths.
- **Tool Integration:** Equip agents with tools for web browsing, file operations, API calls, and more.
- **Streaming Results:** Get live updates as agents reason and execute tasks.

### Ready-to-Use Agent Examples

NodeTool includes several pre-built agent examples:

- **Wikipedia-Style Research Agent:** Generates structured documentation via web research.
- **ChromaDB Research Agent:** Processes and indexes documents for semantic querying.
- **Social Media Analysis Agents:** Tracks and analyzes content from Twitter/X, Instagram, and Reddit.
- **Professional Research Tools:** Analyzes the LinkedIn job market and performs advanced Google searches.
- **Utility Agents:** Processes emails and integrates web search capabilities.

Find full implementations and more examples in the [examples directory](https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-core/tree/main/examples) of the `nodetool-core` repository.

## üöÄ Quickstart (Release Info)

Release 0.6 is in pre-release.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

Follow these steps to set up a local development environment for the entire NodeTool platform, including the UI, backend services, and the core library (`nodetool-core`). If you are primarily interested in contributing to the core library itself, please also refer to the [nodetool-core repository](https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-core) for its specific development setup using Poetry.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11:** Required for the backend.
- **Conda:** Download and install from [miniconda.org](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
- **Node.js (Latest LTS):** Required for the frontend. Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en).

### 1. Set Up Conda Environment

```bash
# Create and activate the Conda environment
conda create -n nodetool python=3.11 -y
conda activate nodetool

# Install essential system dependencies via Conda
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg cairo x264 x265 aom libopus libvorbis lame pandoc uv -y
```

### 2. Install Core Python Dependencies

These are the essential packages to run NodeTool.

Make sure to activate the conda environment.

```bash
# Install nodetool-core and nodetool-base
# On macOS / Linux / Windows:
uv pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-core
uv pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-base
```

### 3. Install Optional Node Packs (As Needed)

NodeTool's functionality is extended via packs. Install only the ones you need.

NOTE:
- Activate the conda environment first
- Use uv for faster installs.

```bash
# List available packs (optional)
nodetool package list -a

# Example: Install packs for specific integrations
uv pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-huggingface
uv pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-fal
uv pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-replicate
uv pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-elevenlabs
```

_Note:_ Some packs like `nodetool-huggingface` may require specific PyTorch versions or CUDA drivers. Use the `-index-url` when necessary:

* https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
* https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

### 4. Run NodeTool Backend & Web UI

Ensure the `nodetool` Conda environment is active.

**Option A: Run Backend with Web UI (for Development)**

This command starts the backend server:

```bash
# On macOS / Linux / Windows:
nodetool serve --reload
```

Run frontend in web folder:
```bash
npm start
```


Access the UI in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Option B: Run with Electron App**

This provides the full desktop application experience.

**Configure Conda Path:**
Ensure your `settings.yaml` file points to your Conda environment path:

- macOS/Linux: `~/.config/nodetool/settings.yaml`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/nodetool/settings.yaml`

```yaml
CONDA_ENV: /path/to/your/conda/envs/nodetool # e.g., /Users/me/miniconda3/envs/nodetool
```

**Build Frontends:**
You only need to do this once or when frontend code changes.

```bash
# Build the main web UI
cd web
npm install
npm run build
cd ..

# Build the apps UI (if needed)
cd apps
npm install
npm run build
cd ..

# Build the Electron UI
cd electron
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

**Start Electron:**

```bash
cd electron
npm start  # launches the desktop app using the previously built UI
```

The Electron app will launch, automatically starting the backend and frontend.

## üì¶ NodeTool Packs Registry

Extend NodeTool's capabilities with specialized **Node Packs**. The [NodeTool Packs Registry](https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-registry) manages discovery, installation, and distribution.

### Using Packs (For Users)

Manage packs easily through the **NodeTool UI**:

- Browse available packs.
- Install, uninstall, and update packs (uses `pip` behind the scenes).
- View pack details and documentation.

Alternatively, install directly via `pip` (see [Development Setup](#3-install-optional-node-packs-as-needed)).

Refer to the [NodeTool Registry repository](https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-registry) for detailed guidelines on creating and publishing packs.

## üìö Documentation

The documentation site is built with Jekyll on GitHub Pages. Markdown files live in the `docs/` directory and changes on `main` are deployed automatically. Start with the [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) guide and browse our new [Tips and Tricks](docs/tips-and-tricks.md) section for handy workflow shortcuts.
