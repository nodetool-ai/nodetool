## Why Privacy‑First Matters

| Local-first by default | Open source & auditable | Controlled cloud bursting |
|-----------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| All model inference runs on your machine. No data leaves unless you decide. | NodeTool is 100% open source under AGPL – audit every line of code. | Need more power? Use API providers or remote GPU workers |

Let's build amazing AI workflows together! ✨

## 🚀 Quickstart (Release Info)

Release 0.6 is in pre-release.

## 🛠️ Development Setup

Follow these steps to set up a local development environment for the entire NodeTool platform, including the UI, backend services, and the core library (`nodetool-core`). If you are primarily interested in contributing to the core library itself, please also refer to the [nodetool-core repository](https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-core) for its specific development setup using Poetry.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11:** Required for the backend.
- **Conda:** Download and install from [miniconda.org](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
- **Node.js (Latest LTS):** Required for the frontend. Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en).

### 1. Set Up Conda Environment

```bash
# Create and activate the Conda environment
conda create -n nodetool python=3.11 -y
conda activate nodetool

# Install essential system dependencies via Conda
conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg cairo x264 x265 aom libopus libvorbis lame pandoc uv -y
```

### 2. Install Core Python Dependencies

These are the essential packages to run NodeTool.

Make sure to activate the conda environment.

```bash
# Install nodetool-core and nodetool-base
# On macOS / Linux / Windows:
uv pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-core
uv pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-base
```

### 3. Install Optional Node Packs (As Needed)

NodeTool's functionality is extended via packs. Install only the ones you need.

NOTE:
- Activate the conda environment first
- Always use uv as we define extra index for pytorch

```bash
# List available packs (optional)
nodetool package list -a

# Example: Install packs for specific integrations
uv pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-huggingface
uv pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-fal
uv pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-replicate
uv pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-elevenlabs
```

_Note:_ Some packs like `nodetool-huggingface` may require specific PyTorch versions or CUDA drivers. Use the `--extra-index-url` when necessary.

### 4. Run NodeTool Backend & Web UI

Ensure the `nodetool` Conda environment is active.

**Option A: Run Backend with Web UI (for Development)**

This command starts the backend server:

```bash
# On macOS / Linux / Windows:
nodetool serve --reload
```

Run frontend in web folder:
```bash
npm start
```


Access the UI in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

**Option B: Run with Electron App**

This provides the full desktop application experience.

**Configure Conda Path:**
Ensure your `settings.yaml` file points to your Conda environment path:

- macOS/Linux: `~/.config/nodetool/settings.yaml`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%/nodetool/settings.yaml`

```yaml
CONDA_ENV: /path/to/your/conda/envs/nodetool # e.g., /Users/me/miniconda3/envs/nodetool
```

**Build Frontends:**
You only need to do this once or when frontend code changes.

```bash
# Build the main web UI
cd web
npm install
npm run build
cd ..

# Build the apps UI (if needed)
cd apps
npm install
npm run build
cd ..

# Build the Electron UI
cd electron
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

**Start Electron:**

```bash
cd electron
npm start  # launches the desktop app using the previously built UI
```

The Electron app will launch, automatically starting the backend and frontend.

## 📦 NodeTool Packs Registry

Extend NodeTool's capabilities with specialized **Node Packs**. The [NodeTool Packs Registry](https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-registry) manages discovery, installation, and distribution.

### Using Packs (For Users)

Manage packs easily through the **NodeTool UI**:

- Browse available packs.
- Install, uninstall, and update packs (uses `pip` behind the scenes).
- View pack details and documentation.

Alternatively, install directly via `pip` (see [Development Setup](#3-install-optional-node-packs-as-needed)).

Refer to the [NodeTool Registry repository](https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-registry) for detailed guidelines on creating and publishing packs.

## 📚 Documentation

The documentation site is built with Jekyll on GitHub Pages. Markdown files live in the `docs/` directory and changes on `main` are deployed automatically. Start with the [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) guide and browse our new [Tips and Tricks](docs/tips-and-tricks.md) section for handy workflow shortcuts.
