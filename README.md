## Cool Things You Can Do ‚ú®

Explore these practical examples to see how NodeTool can enhance your daily productivity:

- **Daily Digest using Deepseek R1 üìßüì∞**: Automatically searches your Gmail inbox for emails with '[AINews]' in the subject line from the past week and summarizes them using the Deepseek R1 7B model. This workflow extracts key details such as sender information, main topics, action items, and deadlines, combining them into a concise, categorized summary‚Äîideal for efficiently staying updated on important AI news without sifting through multiple emails.

- **Pokemon Maker üêâ‚ú®**: Create unique and imaginative Pokemon with detailed descriptions and visually stunning images using AI. Input animal inspirations and get custom Pokemon complete with types, abilities, and personalities.

- **Simple RAG üîçüìö**: A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflow that searches a document collection based on user queries. The system retrieves relevant information from a ChromaDB collection, formats the results into a prompt, and uses the Deepseek-R1 7B model to generate concise, informative answers based on the retrieved content.

- **Style Transfer üé®üñºÔ∏è**: Instantly transform your images into stunning artwork by applying styles from reference images. This workflow uses IP-Adapter to blend artistic elements while ControlNet maintains the original structure, making it perfect for generating creative variations of portraits, landscapes, and more.

```

### Run without Electron

Ensure you have the Conda environment activated.

On macOS and Linux:

```bash
./scripts/server --with-ui --reload
```

On windows:

```bash
.\scripts\server.bat --with-ui --reload
```

Now, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the NodeTool interface.

### Run with Electron

Ensure you have the Conda environment activated and the location is set in the settings file located at `~/.config/nodetool/settings.yaml` or `%APPDATA%/nodetool/settings.yaml` on Windows:

```yaml
CONDA_ENV: /path/to/conda/environment # e.g. /Users/matthias/miniconda3/envs/nodetool
```

Before running Electron, you need to build the frontends located in the `/web` and `/apps` directories:

```bash
cd web && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
cd apps && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
```

Once the build is complete, you can start the Electron app:

```bash
cd electron
npm install
npm start
```

The Electron app starts the frontend and backend automatically.
