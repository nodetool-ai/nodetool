- **Chain of Thought Reasoning**: Enable step-by-step problem solving with explicit reasoning
- **Tool Integration**: Provide agents with capabilities like web browsing, file operations, and more
- **Streaming Results**: Get live updates during the reasoning and execution process

### Architecture Components

The agent system consists of:

1. **Agents**: Specialized problem-solvers with specific capabilities and objectives
2. **Task Planner**: Creates structured, dependency-aware execution plans
3. **Task Execution System**: Executes plans while managing resources and tracking progress
4. **Chat Interfaces**: Both programmatic and CLI interfaces for interacting with agents
5. **Tool System**: Extensible framework for providing agents with external capabilities

### Example Agent Usage

```python
from nodetool.chat.agent import Agent
from nodetool.chat.providers.anthropic import AnthropicProvider

# Initialize a provider
provider = get_provider(Provider.Anthropic)
model = "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"

# Create a retrieval agent
retrieval_agent = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    objective="Gather comprehensive information about quantum computing",
    provider=provider,
    model=model,
    tools=[SearchTool(), BrowserTool()],
)
```

### Available Agent Examples

NodeTool includes several ready-to-use agent examples:

- **Wikipedia-Style Research Agent**: Creates structured documentation through web research

## Cool Things You Can Do ‚ú®

Explore these practical examples to see how NodeTool can enhance your daily productivity:

- **Daily Digest using LLMs üìßüì∞**: Automatically searches your Gmail inbox and summarizes them using LLMs. This workflow extracts key details such as sender information, main topics, action items, and deadlines, combining them into a concise, categorized summary‚Äîideal for efficiently staying updated on important AI news without sifting through multiple emails.

- **Pokemon Maker üêâ‚ú®**: Create unique and imaginative Pokemon with detailed descriptions and visually stunning images using AI. Input animal inspirations and get custom Pokemon complete with types, abilities, and personalities.

- **Simple RAG üîçüìö**: A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflow that searches a document collection based on user queries. The system retrieves relevant information from a ChromaDB collection, formats the results into a prompt, and uses the Deepseek-R1 7B model to generate concise, informative answers based on the retrieved content.

- **Style Transfer üé®üñºÔ∏è**: Instantly transform your images into stunning artwork by applying styles from reference images. This workflow uses IP-Adapter to blend artistic elements while ControlNet maintains the original structure, making it perfect for generating creative variations of portraits, landscapes, and more.

### Run without Electron

Ensure you have the Conda environment activated.

On macOS and Linux:

```bash
./scripts/server --with-ui --reload
```

On windows:

```bash
.\scripts\server.bat --with-ui --reload
```

Now, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the NodeTool interface.

### Run with Electron

Ensure you have the Conda environment activated and the location is set in the settings file located at `~/.config/nodetool/settings.yaml` or `%APPDATA%/nodetool/settings.yaml` on Windows:

```yaml
CONDA_ENV: /path/to/conda/environment # e.g. /Users/matthias/miniconda3/envs/nodetool
```

Before running Electron, you need to build the frontends located in the `/web` and `/apps` directories:

```bash
cd web && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
cd apps && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
```

Once the build is complete, you can start the Electron app:

```bash
cd electron
npm install
npm start
```

The Electron app starts the frontend and backend automatically.

## NodeTool Packs Registry üì¶

NodeTool's functionality can be extended through node packs - collections of specialized nodes that provide additional capabilities. The [NodeTool Packs Registry](https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-registry) manages the installation, distribution, and discovery of these packs.

### For Users: Managing Packs üîç

The primary interface for managing packs is through the NodeTool UI, which provides a user-friendly way to:

- Browse available node packs
- Install/uninstall packs (using pip under the hood)
- Update packs
- View pack information and documentation

### For Developers: Creating Node Packs üõ†Ô∏è

To create and share your own NodeTool packs:

1. **Initialize a new pack**: Use the NodeTool CLI to create a new pack project

   ```bash
   nodetool init
   # Follow prompts to set up your project (name must start with 'nodetool-')
   ```

2. **Develop your nodes**: Create custom node classes that extend BaseNode

   ```python
   from pydantic import Field
   from nodetool.workflows.base_node import BaseNode

   class MyNode(BaseNode):
       """Example node implementation"""

       prompt: str = Field(
           default="Build me a website for my business.",
           description="Input prompt for the node"
       )

       async def process(self, context: ProcessingContext) -> str:
           # Your node implementation here
           return "Node output"
   ```

3. **Generate metadata**: Run `nodetool scan` in your pack repository to create node metadata

4. **Publish your pack**:
   - Commit and publish your project to a GitHub repository
   - Fork the [NodeTool Registry](https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-registry)
   - Add your pack information to index.json
   - Submit a pull request

Check out the [NodeTool Registry repository](https://github.com/nodetool-ai/nodetool-registry) for more detailed instructions on creating, testing, and publishing your node packs.

### Discovering Available Packs üîé

To see what packs are available:

```bash
nodetool list --available
```

### Installing Packs üì•

You can install packs directly using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/your-pack-name
```

Or use the NodeTool UI's pack management interface for a more visual experience.
