# Coverage Improvement Summary

## Tests Added
1. **binary.test.ts** - Improved from basic tests to comprehensive coverage (86.66% coverage)
   - Added tests for empty arrays, binary data, error handling
   - Fixed test expectations to match actual error handling behavior
   
2. **nodeUtils.test.ts** - New test file created (100% coverage)
   - Tests for GROUP_NODE_TYPE constant
   - Tests for GROUP_NODE_METADATA structure
   - Tests for COMMENT_NODE_METADATA structure
   - Comparison tests between metadata objects

3. **ColorUtils.test.ts** - Added edge case test
   - Test for invalid gradient mode handling (default case)

## Coverage Improvements
- binary.ts: 0% → 86.66% statement coverage
- nodeUtils.ts: 0% → 100% statement coverage  
- ColorUtils.ts: Already had good coverage, added missing edge case

## Next Steps for Further Coverage Improvement
1. Fix canvas module issue to enable full test suite execution
2. Add tests for more zero-coverage utilities:
   - createAssetFile.ts
   - errorHandling.ts  
   - highlightText.ts
   - workflowSearch.ts
3. Add tests for hooks with 0% coverage
4. Add tests for stores with 0% coverage

## Notes
- Many tests fail due to canvas module compilation issues
- Added @jest-environment node directive to avoid jsdom/canvas dependency
- Tests that work properly show significant coverage improvement
