# Examples

Small Node.js scripts demonstrating how to interact with the NodeTool API.
These samples show running a workflow via HTTP streaming or through the
WebSocket runner.

- `run_workflow_streaming.js` – uses HTTP long polling / streaming
- `run_workflow_websocket.js` – communicates with a worker over WebSockets

Run the examples with `node <script>` after starting a local NodeTool server.
