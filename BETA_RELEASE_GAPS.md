**Overall Readiness:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NOT READY** - Requires attention to critical gaps

---

## üî¥ Critical Blockers (Must Fix Before Beta)

### 1. Missing Community & Governance Documentation

**Impact:** High - Affects community adoption and contribution clarity

- ‚ùå No `SECURITY.md` - No security policy or vulnerability reporting process
- ‚ùå No `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - No community behavior guidelines
- ‚ùå No `CONTRIBUTING.md` - No contributor guidelines or development process
- ‚ùå No issue/PR templates in `.github/`
- ‚ùå No public roadmap or beta expectations document

**Recommendation:** Create these files immediately. Essential for open-source beta releases.

### 2. Testing Coverage Gaps

**Impact:** Critical - Risk of bugs reaching production

**Current State:**
- Web UI: **11% test coverage** (87 test files / 780 source files)
- Electron: Reasonable coverage (17 test files)
- Apps: Minimal coverage (5 test files)
- No integration tests for critical paths
- No E2E tests for user workflows

**Specific Gaps:**
- No tests for workflow execution pipeline
- No tests for asset upload/download flows
- No tests for model download manager
- No tests for WebSocket communication
- Missing tests for authentication flows

**Recommendation:** Aim for at least 60% coverage on critical paths before beta.

### 3. Code Quality Issues

**Impact:** High - Technical debt and maintenance burden

**Issues Found:**
- 466 TypeScript suppressions (`@ts-ignore`, `@ts-nocheck`, `any` types)
- 149 console.log/error/warn statements in production code
- 5 TODO/FIXME comments indicating incomplete work
- Multiple deprecated dependencies flagged

**Recommendation:** 
- Remove all console.log statements (use proper logger)
- Reduce TypeScript suppressions by 80%
- Address all TODO items or document as known issues

### 4. Deployment & Infrastructure Gaps

**Impact:** Critical - Affects release process and user experience

**Missing:**
- ‚ùå No Docker/container support for self-hosting
- ‚ùå No database migration system (risk of data loss on upgrades)
- ‚ùå No backup/restore functionality
- ‚ùå No health check endpoints
- ‚ùå No monitoring/observability setup (beyond Sentry)
- ‚ùå No load testing or performance benchmarks
- ‚ùå No disaster recovery plan

**Present:**
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline for testing (GitHub Actions)
- ‚úÖ Release automation (multi-platform builds)
- ‚úÖ Sentry error tracking configured

**Recommendation:** Add Docker support and migration system before beta.
