Your job is to increase the coverage of web test suite.

You can run coverage with npm run test:coverage in the web folder.

You have access to the nodetool repository.

Make a commit once a new test is working and all tests pass.

ALL TESTS MUST PASS!

Use the .agent/ directory as a scratchpad for your work. Store long term plans and todo lists there.
