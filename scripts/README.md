# Scripts

Utility scripts used during development and release.

- `changelog.py` – generates the CHANGELOG from git history
- `release.py` – bumps version numbers and builds release artifacts
- `release/` – helper scripts invoked by CI during publishing

These scripts are typically executed manually by maintainers.
