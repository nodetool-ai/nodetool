# NODETOOL MANIFESTO

### The Local‑First Agent OS

## Vision

Your AI, your rules.
Nodetool Agents run on your devices, where your data lives.
Transparent. Portable. Under your control.

## Mission

Ship an open‑source system for designing, running, and deploying agent graphs anywhere.

## Principles

- **Local‑first, by design.**
- **No data leaves without explicit consent.**
- **Open and portable.** Graphs are open and run anywhere.
- **One graph. One runtime.** Visual and headless share the same semantics.
- **Typed tools.** Small, composable nodes with explicit I/O.
- **Reproducible runs.** Seeds, inputs, and artifacts are captured.
- **No black boxes.** Inspect every step as it runs.
- **Fast on your hardware.** Optimized for small GPUs.

## What NodeTool Is (today)

- Visual graph editor + runnable runtime (desktop + headless)
- Execute via CLI, HTTP API, or WebSocket; graphs in JSON/DSL
- Local models (Ollama/HF) + optional cloud (OpenAI/Gemini/Anthropic/Replicate/Fal/Huggingface Hub)
- Deploy to laptop/server, Runpod, or Google Cloud

## What NodeTool Is Not (today)

- Managed SaaS with SLAs or multi‑tenant hosting
- Compliance‑grade policy or audit tooling
- An autoscaling orchestration platform
- A one‑click content toy

## Who It’s For

Indie hackers, game devs, AI enthusiasts, creative professionals, agencies, and studios who want to build and run their own pipelines—with control and local ownership of data and IP.

## Roadmap

- **Creative pipelines:** ready‑to‑use templates for thumbnails, game sprites, ad variants, research briefs.

- **Packaging:** one‑click bundles for sharing pipelines with collaborators or clients.

- **Video tooling:** timeline nodes, effects, and batch rendering.

- **Community packs:** growing registry of open nodes for creative tasks (effects, generators, integrations).

## Promise

Open core. Local‑first. You own the models, the workflows, and the data.
