# NODETOOL MANIFESTO

### Your Visual AI Creative Studio

## Vision

Creative AI should be yours.
Run it beside your work, on your machine.
Transparent, flexible, and under your control.

## Mission

Build an open-source visual studio for creators to design and run AI workflows. Privacy by default. Cloud when you choose.

## Principles

- **Create freely.** No limits, no subscriptions, no gatekeepers.
- **Your work stays yours.** Data never leaves without your permission.
- **See the magic happen.** Watch every creative step in real-time.
- **Mix your tools.** Combine local AI with cloud services however you want.
- **Share your process.** Save, export, and share your creative workflows.
- **Experiment fearlessly.** Undo, iterate, perfect—all visible and controllable.
- **Own your creations.** Run on your hardware. Keep your IP private.

## What NodeTool Is (today)

- Visual canvas + creative AI runtime (desktop + web)
- Generate, transform, and combine media with AI nodes
- Local models (Flux/SDXL/Whisper) + cloud APIs (OpenAI/Anthropic/Replicate)
- Create on laptop, deploy to cloud if you want
- Share as Mini-Apps for collaborators and clients

## What NodeTool Is Not (today)

- Yet another subscription SaaS
- A locked-down creative platform
- A one-click content farm
- Limited to cloud-only services

## Who It’s For

Indie hackers, Game devs, AI enthusiasts, creative professionals, agencies, and studios who want to create with AI while keeping control of their process and work. They value creative freedom, privacy, and the ability to experiment without limits.

## Roadmap

- **Creative templates:** Ready-to-use workflows for art, video, music, and content.
- **Version history:** See your creative evolution, compare versions, rollback.
- **Batch creation:** Generate variations and A/B test ideas at scale.
- **Community gallery:** Share workflows, discover techniques, learn from creators.

## Promise

Open source. Privacy first. Own your creative process, your workflows, and everything you make.
