# NODETOOL MANIFESTO

### The Local‑First Agent Workbench

## Vision

AI should be yours.
Agents run locally, beside your data.
They are transparent, portable, and under your control.

## Mission

Ship an open-source system to design and run agents as graphs on your machines. Cloud is opt-in.

## Principles

- **Local‑first. Always.**
- **No data leaves without consent.**
- **Open and portable.**&#x20;
- **One graph. One runtime.** Visual and headless share semantics.
- **Typed tools.** Small, composable, explicit I/O.
- **Reproducible runs.** Seeds and inputs captured.
- **No black boxes.** See every step while it runs.
- **Fast on your hardware.** Cloud only when you choose.

## What NodeTool Is (today)

- Visual graph editor + runnable runtime (desktop + headless)
- Execute via CLI, API, WebSocket; graphs in JSON
- Local models (Ollama/HF) + optional cloud (OpenAI/Anthropic/Replicate)
- Deploy to laptop/server, Runpod, Google Cloud, AWS

## What NodeTool Is Not (today)

- Managed SaaS, SLAs, multi‑tenant
- Compliance‑grade policy/audit
- Autoscaling orchestrator
- One‑click content toy

## Who It’s For

Indie hackers, Game devs, AI enthusiasts, creative professionals, agencies, and studios who want to build and run their own pipelines. They care about control, reproducibility, and keeping data and IP local.

## Roadmap

- **Creative pipelines:**\*\* templates for thumbnails, sprites, ad variants, research briefs.
- **Timeline & Snapshots:** run history, diffs, and easy rollback.
- **Render Queue & A/B:** batch runs and seeded comparisons.
- **Packaging:** one‑click bundles for sharing with collaborators/clients; community packs registry.

## Promise

Open core. Local‑first. Own the runtime, the workflows, and the outputs.
