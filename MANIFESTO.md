# NodeTool Manifesto

## Vision

AI belongs on your machine, next to your data.
Not behind a paywall. Not in someone else's cloud.
Transparent. Flexible. Yours.

## Mission

Build an open-source visual platform for everyone to design and run AI workflows. Privacy by default. Cloud when you choose.

## Principles

- **Build visually** - Connect blocks, not code
- **Your data stays yours** - It doesn't leave unless you send it
- **See every step** - Watch your workflow execute in real-time
- **Mix your tools** - Combine local AI with cloud services
- **Share your work** - Export, deploy, collaborate
- **Experiment freely** - Iterate, undo, perfect
- **Own your infrastructure** - Run on your hardware

## What NodeTool Is

A visual workflow builder + AI runtime (desktop + web) that lets you:

- Generate content, process data, automate with AI
- Run models locally (Flux/SDXL/Whisper/LLMs) or use cloud APIs (OpenAI/Anthropic/Replicate)
- Work on your laptop, deploy to cloud when needed
- Share workflows as Mini-Apps or deploy as APIs

## What NodeTool Is Not (today)

- Yet another SaaS subscription
- A closed platform with vendor lock-in
- Limited to cloud-only services
- A one-size-fits-all solution

## Who It’s For

Indie hackers, Game devs, AI enthusiasts, creative professionals, agencies, and studios who want to build and run AI workflows while keeping control. They value flexibility, privacy, and the ability to work without restrictions.

## Roadmap

- **Workflow templates** - Ready examples for common tasks
- **Version control** - Track changes, compare versions, rollback
- **Batch processing** - Run workflows at scale with variations
- **Community hub** - Share workflows, discover patterns, learn

## Promise

Open source. Privacy first.
Own your workflows, your data, everything you build.
