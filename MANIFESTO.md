# NODETOOL MANIFESTO

### The Visual AI Workflow Platform

## Vision

AI should be yours.
Run it on your machine, beside your data.
Transparent, flexible, and under your control.

## Mission

Build an open-source visual platform for everyone to design and run AI workflows. Privacy by default. Cloud when you choose.

## Principles

- **Build visually.** Connect blocks, not code. Accessible to everyone.
- **Your data stays yours.** Never leaves without your permission.
- **See every step.** Watch workflows execute in real-time.
- **Mix your tools.** Combine local AI with cloud services as you need.
- **Share your work.** Export, deploy, and collaborate.
- **Experiment freely.** Iterate, undo, perfect—all visible and controllable.
- **Own your infrastructure.** Run on your hardware. Keep control.

## What NodeTool Is (today)

- Visual workflow builder + AI runtime (desktop + web)
- Generate content, process data, and automate with AI
- Local models (Flux/SDXL/Whisper/LLMs) + cloud APIs (OpenAI/Anthropic/Replicate)
- Run on laptop, deploy to cloud when needed
- Share as Mini-Apps or deploy as APIs

## What NodeTool Is Not (today)

- Yet another SaaS subscription
- A closed platform with vendor lock-in
- Limited to cloud-only services
- A one-size-fits-all solution

## Who It’s For

Indie hackers, Game devs, AI enthusiasts, creative professionals, agencies, and studios who want to build and run AI workflows while keeping control. They value flexibility, privacy, and the ability to work without restrictions.

## Roadmap

- **Workflow templates:** Ready-to-use examples for common AI tasks.
- **Version control:** Track workflow evolution, compare versions, rollback changes.
- **Batch processing:** Run workflows at scale with variations.
- **Community hub:** Share workflows, discover patterns, learn from others.

## Promise

Open source. Privacy first. Own your workflows, your data, and everything you build.
