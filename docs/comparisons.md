NodeTool is a visual workflow builder for AI pipelines – connecting LLMs, image generation, audio, and video. It runs locally or via cloud APIs.

It focuses on multi-modal AI workflows with a visual editor, real-time streaming output, and local-first execution. It's designed to make building AI pipelines accessible without sacrificing flexibility.

NodeTool can integrate with external services via HTTP when needed.
