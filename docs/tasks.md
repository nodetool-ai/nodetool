# Docs Cleanup Tasks

- [x] Add a Security Hardening checklist page and keep existing references working.
- [x] Point the DSL link in `packages.md` to `developer/dsl-guide.md`.
- [x] Replace the missing Chat Providers link with working targets in `providers.md`.
- [x] Add Docker Resource Management guidance so proxy/storage links resolve.
- [x] Fix the Providers anchor in `models-and-providers.md` (`#getting-api-keys`).
- [x] Clean up the API demo download link in `workflow-api.md`.
- [x] Verify and update links that point outside `docs/` (e.g., `../src/...`, `../examples/...`, `../CLAUDE.md`).
- [x] Improve navigation for orphaned pages (README, TESTING_PROCESS, architecture, asset-management, chat, glossary, indexing, node-packs, terminal-websocket, tips-and-tricks, workflow-editor).
- [x] Add persona entry points in `index.md` and reduce duplication across deployment docs.
- [x] Cross-link workflow examples with related patterns in `cookbook/patterns.md`.
- [x] Clarify configuration/auth canonicalization and Supabase references.
- [ ] Sweep minor consistency/readability items (namespaces, “Next steps” endings).
