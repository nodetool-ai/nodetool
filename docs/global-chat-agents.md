Global Chat is the always-on assistant that can run any workflow, stream results, and escalate to autonomous agents when a task needs planning. Use this page to jump to the right references.

## Core guides

- **[Global Chat](global-chat.md)** — Interface layout, thread management, and how chat invokes workflows or tools.
- **[NodeTool Agent System](agents.md)** — How planning, tool usage, and execution loops work under the hood.
- **[Global Chat CLI](chat-cli.md)** & **[Chat Server](chat-server.md)** — Automate conversations or integrate with custom frontends.
- **[Chat API](chat-api.md)** — Programmatic access for running chats, streaming outputs, and issuing tool calls.

## Typical flows

1. **Run any saved workflow from chat**  
   Save the workflow in the editor, open Global Chat, and choose **Run workflow** in the composer—perfect for ad-hoc runs or sharing with non-builders.

2. **Enable Agent Mode for planning tasks**  
   Switch to Agent Mode to let the LLM break goals into subtasks, call frontend tools (add nodes, align graphs), and update the workflow automatically. See the [Agent guide](agents.md#key-features).

3. **Expose agents via APIs or CLI**  
   Use the [Chat CLI](chat-cli.md) for automation scripts, or call the [Chat API](chat-api.md) from backend services so agents can operate in headless environments.

4. **Stream updates back into editors**  
   Workflow changes generated by agents propagate to open editors via WebSocket updates, keeping the canvas synced without manual refresh.
