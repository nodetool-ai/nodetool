The workflow editor is where you design and run AI pipelines. Nodes represent tasks and edges define how data flows between them.

### Creating nodes

- Press the **Space** key or double‑click the canvas to open the node menu.
- Search or browse namespaces to find the node you need.
- Drag nodes onto the canvas and connect their inputs and outputs.

### Managing the graph

- Use the toolbar to **save** your workflow or arrange nodes automatically with **Auto Layout**.
- Undo and redo changes using <kbd>Ctrl+Z</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Z</kbd>.
- Right‑click to open context menus for nodes, inputs and the canvas.

### Running workflows

- Click the **Run** button or press <kbd>Ctrl+Enter</kbd> to execute the workflow.
- Status updates and results stream back in real time.
- Workflows can run locally or dispatch jobs to remote workers.

### Tabs and panels

- Multiple workflows can be open in tabs at once.
- Panels on the left provide access to assets, settings and logs.
