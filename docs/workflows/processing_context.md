# nodetool.workflows.processing_context

## ProcessingContext

The processing context is the workflow's interface to the outside world.

Initialization and State Management:
- Initializes the context with user ID, authentication token, workflow ID, graph edges, nodes and a message queue.
- Manages the results of processed nodes and keeps track of processed nodes.
- Provides methods for popping and posting messages to the message queue.

Asset Management:
- Provides methods for finding, downloading, and creating assets (images, audio, text, video, dataframes, models).
- Handles conversions between different asset formats (e.g., PIL Image to ImageRef, numpy array to ImageRef).
- Generates presigned URLs for accessing assets.

API and Storage Integration:
- Interacts with the Nodetool API client for asset-related operations.
- Retrieves and manages asset storage and temporary storage instances.
- Handles file uploads and downloads to/from storage services.

Workflow Execution:
- Runs the workflow by sending a RunJobRequest to a remote worker.
- Processes and handles various types of messages received from the worker (node progress, updates, errors).

Utility Methods:
- Provides helper methods for converting values for prediction, handling enums, and parsing S3 URLs.
- Supports data conversion between different formats (e.g., TextRef to string, DataFrame to pandas DataFrame).

**Tags:** It maintains the state of the workflow and provides methods for interacting with the environment.
