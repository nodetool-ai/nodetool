# Documentation

This directory contains the sources for the NodeTool documentation site. The site
is built with Jekyll and published to <https://nodetool.ai>.

Key locations:

- `index.md` – landing page for the docs site
- `getting-started.md` – quick start guide for new users
- `api/` – reference for the HTTP and WebSocket APIs
- `assets/` – images and static files used in the documentation

Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` from this folder to preview the docs locally.
