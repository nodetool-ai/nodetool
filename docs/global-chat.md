- The chat view fills the screen with your conversation list on the left.

### Managing threads

- Click a thread to switch to it. Each item shows a preview of your first message and when it was last updated.
- Remove a thread with the delete button.

### Composing messages

- Type in the message box and press **Enter** to send.
- Drag files onto the input to include images, audio or video.
- Use the stop button to cancel streaming if needed.

### Models and tools

- Pick an AI model from the **Model** menu.
- Optional tool selectors let the assistant search online or run workflow nodes.
- **Agent Mode** allows the assistant to decide when to use tools.
- **Help Mode** asks the assistant to explain its reasoning.

### Status indicators
