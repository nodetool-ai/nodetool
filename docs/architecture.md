# Architecture Overview

This page explains how the pieces of NodeTool fit together. The codebase is split into multiple packages that interact through a simple client‑server design.

## Repository Structure

- **`web/`** – React application containing the main workflow editor.
- **`apps/`** – Mini‑app builder that packages workflows as standalone apps.
- **`electron/`** – Electron wrapper providing the desktop experience and system tray integration.
- **`workflow_runner/`** – Lightweight WebSocket client used to show workflow progress.
- **`examples/`** – Node.js scripts demonstrating how to call the API.
- **`scripts/`** – Helper scripts for building and releasing NodeTool.

The Python backend lives inside the main repository and exposes a FastAPI server plus a WebSocket runner. Workers connect locally or remotely to execute nodes with CPU or GPU models.

## Data Flow

1. The **Web UI** communicates with the API server over HTTP for management tasks (saving workflows, listing assets, etc.).
2. During execution, the UI and other clients connect to the **WebSocket Runner** to receive live updates.
3. **Workers** run the individual nodes in a workflow. They can call external AI APIs such as OpenAI or Hugging Face when configured.
4. Results are streamed back through the runner to the frontends in real time.

This modular approach keeps the core editor lightweight while enabling heavy computation on dedicated workers or in the cloud.
