Research basis: an audit of `marketing/` (the nodetool.ai Next.js site), `docs/`, the 61 example
workflows in `packages/base-nodes/nodetool/examples/`, and the node packages in `packages/`, plus
external research on competitor positioning and search behavior (sources linked inline). Written
2026-07-01 — re-audit the live site before acting on the numbers below if this file is more than a
quarter old.

## 1. Where nodetool.ai stands today

The site (`marketing/src/app/`) has 13 indexed pages: `/`, `/studio`, `/cloud`, `/pricing`,
`/agents`, `/creatives`, `/developers`, two comparison pages (`/vs/comfyui`, `/vs/weavy`), two
use-case pages (`/use-cases/product-video`, `/use-cases/movie-poster`), and three legal pages.

Four gaps stand out:

- **`/use-cases/movie-trailer` exists but is missing from `sitemap.ts`** (`marketing/src/app/sitemap.ts`).
  It has a page folder and an entry in `useCaseEntries.ts` but never reaches search engines. Fix
  this regardless of anything else in this doc — it's a one-line omission, not a strategy question.
- **No blog.** Every competitor identified in research below (Dify, n8n, Flowise, Langflow, Lindy,
  Gumloop, Vellum, StackAI, Wireflow) runs a blog and ranks on "X vs Y" and "best tools for Z"
  queries, which is exactly the traffic NodeTool needs and currently cedes to them.
- **3 use-case pages for 61 shipped example workflows.** The `useCaseEntries.ts` pattern (a single
  data array plus a matching page folder) is already built to scale — it's just underused by a
  factor of 20.
- **No `/marketing` segment page.** The homepage and `/creatives` copy both explicitly name
  "marketing teams" as a target audience, and one of the three flagship use cases (Product Video
  Generator) is already tagged `category: "Marketing"` in `useCaseEntries.ts`. But the nav
  (Studio, Cloud, Creatives, Agents, Developers, Pricing) has no landing page built for that
  audience — marketing searches currently land on the general `/creatives` page instead of copy
  written for their job (campaigns, social calendars, brand consistency, output volume), same as
  `/agents` serves automation and `/developers` serves engineers. See §4.0.

The existing meta setup is solid: `layout.tsx` already ships title/description/OG/Twitter tags and
a keyword list (creative AI workspace, BYOK AI canvas, ComfyUI alternative, Weavy alternative,
node-based AI canvas). `robots.txt` and `sitemap.ts` both exist. The problem is page count and
content depth, not technical hygiene.

## 2. Competitive landscape

Three groups of tools currently absorb the search intent NodeTool could capture:

**LLM/agent workflow builders** — Dify, Flowise, Langflow, n8n. StackAI's comparison names Dify
"the best starting point for most teams in 2026" on debugging and knowledge-base features; Langflow
is positioned for teams that need custom Python nodes and LangGraph; Flowise for the fastest path
to a RAG chatbot; n8n where orchestration (retries, branches, schedules) is the hard part
([Runchat comparison](https://runchat.com/p/runchat/runchat-vs-comfyui-vs-n8n-vs-langflow-visual-ai-to-55)).
None of these natively render image, video, or audio — they're text/LLM-first, which is NodeTool's
opening.

**Node-based creative canvases** — ComfyUI (already covered at `/vs/comfyui`), Weavy (already
covered at `/vs/weavy`, note: acquired by Figma per
[Chase Jarvis's review](https://chasejarvis.com/blog/what-the-heck-is-weavy-the-100-honest-review-after-the-figma-acqusition/)),
plus Flora, Freepik Spaces, Krea, Layer AI, Griptape Nodes, and Reflet.ai — all covered in a single
["2026: The Year of the Node-Based Editor"](https://medium.com/@fadimantium/2026-the-year-of-the-node-based-editor-941f0f15d467)
roundup and multiple "Weavy alternatives" posts
([Wireflow](https://www.wireflow.ai/blog/top-8-ai-weavy-alternatives)). Most are browser-only,
credit-metered SaaS with no local execution and no BYOK — the same gap NodeTool already argues
against Weavy, reusable against this whole category.

**Local-first AI tooling** — Ollama, LM Studio, Jan, Open WebUI cover local chat; none combine
local inference with cloud generation or a visual workflow canvas
([overchat.ai roundup](https://overchat.ai/ai-hub/best-offline-ai-apps),
[needaitool.com roundup](https://www.needaitool.com/blogs/local-ai-apps-2026-ollama-lm-studio-open-webui)).

**Net position**: NodeTool is the only tool showing up across all three searches — LLM/agent
builders don't do media, creative canvases don't do local models or agents, local-first tools don't
do workflows. That's the argument every comparison page and use-case page should make concrete,
not assert abstractly.

## 3. Audience segments and what they search

| Segment | What they search | Where they currently land instead |
|---|---|---|
| Creatives (filmmakers, designers) | "text to video pipeline", "ComfyUI alternative no code", "AI movie poster generator" | Runway, Krea, Melies, Weavy alternatives posts |
| Marketing teams (campaigns, growth, social) | "product video AI tool", "AI content calendar generator", "brand asset generator AI", "AI ad video generator" | Lindy, Gumloop, Runway, Weavy alternatives posts |
| Developers / ML engineers | "open source AI agent framework", "RAG pipeline no code", "TypeScript AI workflow SDK", "custom LLM node builder" | Langflow, Flowise, LlamaIndex RAGArch |
| Automation / ops teams | "n8n alternative for AI agents", "no-code AI workflow local", "email triage AI automation" | n8n, Activepieces, Gumloop |
| Privacy-conscious / local-first users | "run AI models locally desktop app", "local LLM privacy no cloud", "self-hosted AI agent" | Jan, LM Studio, Ollama-based roundups |
| Researchers / knowledge workers | "chat with PDF tool", "summarize research papers AI", "document RAG open source" | Kapa.ai, Prisme.ai |

The site already has landing pages for creatives, developers, and agents (automation). It has none
targeting marketing teams specifically, even though the homepage copy names them by title (see
§4.0) — nor the local-first/privacy segment (this is argued piecemeal on `/studio` and in
comparisons, never as its own page), nor the researcher/knowledge-worker segment (despite shipping
5 document-processing example workflows: Chat with Docs, Index PDFs, Summarize Paper, Fetch Papers,
Meeting Transcript Summarizer).

## 4. Page-type playbooks

### 4.0 Segment landing page — `/marketing`

`/creatives`, `/agents`, and `/developers` are each a persona-framed rewrite of the same product,
built to rank on that persona's job-title searches and to give paid/social traffic a landing page
that speaks their language instead of the generic homepage. Marketing teams get named in that same
homepage copy but have no fourth page.

Build `/marketing` on the identical pattern (`marketing/src/app/creatives/page.tsx` is the closest
template — same section shape: headline, "why teams choose NodeTool" section, use-case teasers,
community/CTA). Content already exists to fill it without new production work:

- **Lead use case**: Product Video Generator (`use-cases/product-video`, already `category:
  "Marketing"` in `useCaseEntries.ts`) — feature it the way `/creatives` features the Movie Poster
  and Movie Trailer generators.
- **Supporting use cases to build** (from the §4.2 backlog, reprioritized for this page): Social
  Media Calendar Filler, Brand Asset Generator, Cold Outreach Co-Pilot, YouTube Thumbnail Pipeline —
  all four are marketing-ops workflows, not creative-production ones, and read oddly grouped under
  "Creatives".
- **Target keywords**: "AI product video generator", "AI content calendar tool", "brand asset
  generator AI", "AI ad video tool open source" (§3).
- **Differentiation angle**: same BYOK/no-markup argument as `/creatives`, reframed around output
  volume and cost-per-asset at campaign scale rather than single-artifact craft — this is the
  argument marketing buyers actually compare tools on (per the n8n/Activepieces/Gumloop comparisons
  in §2, which sell on throughput and integration count, not per-asset quality).

Add `/marketing` to `sitemap.ts` at the same priority tier as the other three segment pages (0.8,
monthly — see §5) and to the main nav alongside Creatives/Agents/Developers.

### 4.1 Comparison pages (`/vs/*`)

Pattern already proven at `marketing/src/app/vs/comfyui/page.tsx` and `vs/weavy/page.tsx`
(feature-table format, ~250 lines each, hand-built per page). Expand from 2 to a target list based
on what people are already comparing:

1. `/vs/langflow` — pull in the "no media generation" gap
2. `/vs/flowise` — same gap, plus BYOK vs. hosted credits
3. `/vs/n8n` — orchestration-only vs. orchestration + native generation
4. `/vs/flora` (or a combined "AI canvas alternatives" page covering Flora, Freepik Spaces, Krea)
5. `/vs/dify` — RAG/agent platform, no creative media
6. `/vs/lmstudio` or `/vs/jan` — local chat only vs. local + cloud workflow canvas

Each page keeps the existing format: one comparison table, one differentiation section, one CTA.
Do not invent a new template per competitor — the value here is coverage, not novelty.

### 4.2 Use-case pages (`/use-cases/*`)

The `useCaseEntries.ts` array is the scaling mechanism: add an entry, build the matching page
folder. 61 example workflows already exist in
`packages/base-nodes/nodetool/examples/nodetool-base/` with titles, descriptions, and (per the
internal audit) natural category groupings. Prioritize by search-intent match, not by what's
easiest to build:

- **Ship first** (clear existing search terms, per §3): Research Paper Summarizer, Chat with Docs
  (→ "chat with PDF"), Meeting Transcript Summarizer, Music Video Visualizer
- **Ship second**: Hacker News Agent / YouTube Research Agent (agent-mode examples double as
  `/agents` landing-page proof)
- **Marketing segment** (feature on `/marketing`, see §4.0): Cold Outreach Co-Pilot, Social Media
  Calendar Filler, Brand Asset Generator, YouTube Thumbnail Pipeline
- **Fix immediately**: add `/use-cases/movie-trailer` to `sitemap.ts` (see §1)

At 61 candidates, treat this as a backlog, not a one-time push — 3-5 new use-case pages per month
sustains a steady stream of long-tail landing pages without a content team.

### 4.3 Node / provider pages

`docs/nodes/<provider>/` and `docs/developer/providers/<provider>.md` already exist for FAL, KIE,
Gemini, ElevenLabs, Together, Replicate, Ollama, HuggingFace, Topaz, AtlasCloud, and more (20+
providers). These are developer docs, not landing pages, but each one is a near-zero-cost target
for provider-name search traffic ("FAL nodes for NodeTool", "use Kling in NodeTool") once they carry
proper titles/descriptions and get linked from `/developers`. No new pages needed here — just meta
tags on what already exists (see §5).

### 4.4 Blog (net new)

No blog exists. This is the biggest structural gap relative to every competitor in §2. Recommended
scope, not a general-purpose blog:

- **Comparison/roundup posts** that NodeTool can legitimately win a mention in: "best ComfyUI
  alternatives 2026", "open source Weavy alternatives", "local-first AI tools 2026" — these are the
  exact post titles already ranking for competitors (§2 sources). Writing NodeTool's own version,
  plus getting listed in the external ones (see §6), covers both sides.
- **Cookbook walkthroughs** built directly from `docs/cookbook/core-concepts.md` and the 15+
  recipes in `docs/cookbook.md` — these already exist as docs; a blog post is a rewrite with a
  narrative frame and screenshots, not new research.
- **Technical posts for the developer segment**: actor-model workflow execution, the Python bridge
  (`PythonStdioBridge`), the planning agent system (`packages/agents/`) — these map to real
  architecture (`docs/architecture.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md`) and target "how do AI agent frameworks
  work" / "TypeScript LLM orchestration" searches from engineers evaluating tools.

## 5. Technical SEO checklist

- [ ] Add `/use-cases/movie-trailer` to `marketing/src/app/sitemap.ts` (confirmed missing, §1)
- [ ] Build `/marketing` (§4.0) and add it to `sitemap.ts` at priority 0.8 / monthly — same tier as
      `/agents`, `/creatives`, `/developers` — plus main nav
- [ ] Confirm every new page under `/vs/`, `/use-cases/`, `/marketing`, and any future `/blog/` gets
      an `opengraph-image.tsx` (existing `vs/*` pages already do this — keep the pattern)
- [ ] Add `priority`/`changeFrequency` entries to `sitemap.ts` for every new page as it ships —
      don't let the list drift out of sync with `app/` folders again
- [ ] Verify `docs/nodes/<provider>/index.md` pages carry unique titles and descriptions (currently
      generated docs; check for duplicate/boilerplate meta across providers)
- [ ] Internal linking: `/agents`, `/creatives`, `/developers`, `/marketing` should each link to the
      use-case pages relevant to their segment (per §3's mapping) — currently the use-case showcase
      only appears on the homepage

## 6. Distribution (off-site)

Content only ranks if something points at it:

- **"Alternatives to X" roundups** (Wireflow, Lindy, Vellum, Gumloop, StackAI, and similar sites
  identified in §2 already publish and rank these lists) — get NodeTool listed via outreach when a
  new comparison or use-case page ships. This is lower effort than link-building from scratch and
  targets people already close to a decision.
- **Directories already listing NodeTool**: futuretools.io, theaidb.com, SourceForge (confirmed via
  search in this audit). Keep listings current with each release; check for others in the same
  category (There's An AI For That, AI Tools Directory sites).
  Adjacent projects to note for competitive tracking, not for outreach: `alvinreal/awesome-opensource-ai`
  and `light-and-ray/awesome-alternative-uis-for-comfyui` on GitHub — both are community-curated
  lists where a PR adding NodeTool is a legitimate, low-effort listing (not unsolicited outreach).
- **GitHub topics and README SEO**: confirm the repo carries relevant GitHub topics (`ai-workflow`,
  `comfyui-alternative`, `llm-agents`, `node-based`, `local-first`) — these surface in GitHub's own
  search and get scraped into "awesome-*" lists.
- **Reddit / Hacker News**: no existing discussion threads found in this audit (searched directly).
  This is upside, not a gap to fix — a Show HN or r/LocalLLaMA / r/comfyui post timed to a specific
  release (e.g., a new local-model integration) reaches an audience already primed for exactly this
  positioning.

## 7. Prioritized roadmap

1. **Immediate** (hours): fix the `movie-trailer` sitemap omission (§1, §5).
2. **Phase 1** (this month): build `/marketing` (§4.0) with its four supporting use-case pages
   (Product Video, Cold Outreach Co-Pilot, Social Media Calendar Filler, Brand Asset Generator);
   ship the remaining "ship first" use-case pages (§4.2); add `/vs/langflow` and `/vs/n8n`
   (highest-volume comparison targets per §2).
3. **Phase 2** (next month): stand up the blog with 3 posts — one comparison/roundup post, one
   cookbook walkthrough, one technical post (§4.4); submit NodeTool to the two GitHub awesome-lists
   named in §6.
4. **Ongoing**: 3-5 use-case pages/month from the remaining 61-workflow backlog; one comparison page
   per new credible competitor; internal-link every new page from its matching segment landing page
   (§5).

## 8. Measurement

Track per page: organic impressions/clicks (Search Console), and which comparison/use-case pages
convert to `/studio` or `/pricing` visits (the two highest-priority pages in the existing sitemap).
Re-run the competitive scan in §2 quarterly — this is a fast-moving category and new entrants
(Flora, Reflet.ai, both surfaced only in this audit's research) can appear within months.
