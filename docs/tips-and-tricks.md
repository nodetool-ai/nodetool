Here are some tips and tricks for using NodeTool more effectively

- **Duplicate Nodes** – Select nodes and press <kbd>Ctrl + D</kbd> or <kbd>⌘ + D</kbd> to create copies.
- **Workflow History** – Use <kbd>Ctrl + Z</kbd> | <kbd>⌘ + Z</kbd> to Undo and <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + Z</kbd> | <kbd>⌘ + Shift + Z</kbd> to Redo changes to your workflow.
- **Fit to Screen / Focus** - Press <kbd>F</kbd> to fit all nodes to screen, or focus on selected nodes.
- **Command Menu** – Press <kbd>Alt + K</kbd> or <kbd>⌘ + K</kbd> to open the command palette and quickly jump between actions.
