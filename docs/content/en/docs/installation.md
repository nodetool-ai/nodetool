NodeTool includes a small setup process the first time you run it. Follow these steps to get started.

## Download the installer

1. Visit [nodetool.ai](https://nodetool.ai) and download the build for Windows, macOS, or Linux.
2. Run the downloaded file to start NodeTool.

## Choose where to install

When NodeTool starts it asks where to keep its Python environment. You can:

- **Use the default location** – recommended for most users.
- **Pick a custom folder** – choose any folder with enough free space (about 20 GB is a good idea).

Select your preferred option to continue.

## Select extra packages

Next you can choose optional features such as cloud AI services, document tools, and audio or image processing. Tick the boxes you need now. You can add more later.

## Let NodeTool download the files

After you click **Install**, NodeTool downloads and unpacks everything it needs. This may take a few minutes depending on your connection. Progress is shown on screen.

Once the download completes, NodeTool opens automatically and you can start building workflows.
