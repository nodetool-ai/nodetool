NodeTool provides two categories of settings that let you tailor the experience to your workflow.

### Interface preferences

Use the **Settings** panel in the left sidebar to adjust how the editor behaves. You can:

- Control snapping for nodes and connections to keep layouts tidy.
- Choose whether panning happens with the left or right mouse button.
- Decide how selections are made when dragging over nodes.
- Pick if workflows and assets are sorted by name or by date.
- Set the size for items in the asset browser.
- Switch between 12h and 24h time display.
- Enable warnings before closing a workflow tab.
- Toggle automatic node selection when dragging.
- Show or hide the welcome dialog on startup.

These options are stored locally so that each user has their own preferences.

### Service configuration

Some features, such as external AI services or custom model folders, require additional information. The **Remote Settings** dialog groups these options by provider. Typical examples include API keys for services like OpenAI and paths for local model directories. Secrets can be edited securely and are saved on your machine in an encrypted form.

Changing these settings may require restarting the desktop app for changes to take effect.
