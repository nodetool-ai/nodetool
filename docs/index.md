# Nodetool - Documentation

NodeTool is an open‑source, local‑first platform for building AI agents and workflows visually. Design, run, and deploy
powerful AI systems using drag‑and‑drop nodes that connect models, tools, data, and your everyday apps.

> Build agents visually • Deploy anywhere • Privacy by design

## How It Works

1. 🏗️ Build — Create workflows by dragging and connecting nodes.
1. ⚡ Run — Test locally; your data stays on your machine by default.
1. 🚀 Deploy — Ship to your own cloud or provider when ready.

## What You Can Do

- **Visual workflow editor** – link nodes to process text, images, audio or video.
- **Extensive model support** – use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face, Groq, Together, Replicate,
  Cohere and more — or run locally with Ollama.
- **Advanced agents** – build multi-step agents that can plan, reason and browse the web.
- **Vector search & RAG** – index your documents and ask questions about them.
- **System tray access** – launch workflows and manage your clipboard from anywhere.
- **Mini‑app builder** – turn a workflow into a standalone application.
- **Chat interface** – create custom chatbots for your projects.
- **Global Chat** – start conversations from anywhere in the workspace with AI agents and tools.
- **OpenAI‑compatible API & extensions** – connect NodeTool to other apps and services.
- **Node Packs** – install extra nodes from the [NodeTool Packs Registry](node-packs.md).
