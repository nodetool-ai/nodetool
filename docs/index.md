NodeTool is a desktop app for building AI-powered workflows with simple drag-and-drop tools. It lets you combine local or cloud models with your everyday apps without writing code.

### Why it exists

NodeTool was created to give anyone the power of modern AI while keeping full control over their data. Run open-source models on your computer or connect to providers like OpenAI and Gemini. Automate tasks, experiment with new ideas and share results without needing a programming background.

### What you can do

- **Visual workflow editor** – link nodes to process text, images, audio or video.
- **Extensive model support** – use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face (including Groq and Cerebras), or run locally with Ollama.
- **Advanced agents** – build multi-step agents that can plan, reason and browse the web.
- **Vector search & RAG** – index your documents and ask questions about them.
- **System tray access** – launch workflows and manage your clipboard from anywhere.
- **Mini‑app builder** – turn a workflow into a standalone application.
- **Chat interface** – create custom chatbots for your projects.
- **Global Chat** – start conversations from anywhere in the workspace with AI agents and tools.
- **API and extensions** – connect NodeTool to other apps with Python scripts.

For a deeper look at how these pieces interact, read the
[Architecture Overview](architecture.md).

### Real-world examples

- Summarize incoming emails or generate daily digests.
- Research topics online and produce structured reports.
- Create images and descriptions for social media posts.
- Ask questions about PDFs or other files you upload.
