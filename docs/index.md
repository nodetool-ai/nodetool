# Welcome to NodeTool Documentation
NodeTool is an open-source platform for visually building and running AI workflows. This site contains reference material for the API as well as guides for using the editor and desktop application.

Use the **Getting Started** page to set up your environment. The API section documents the HTTP and WebSocket endpoints if you wish to integrate NodeTool into other tools.

Additional topics cover advanced workflows, packaging apps, and contributing to the project.
