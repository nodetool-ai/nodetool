## Before You Begin

**What is a workflow?** Think of it like a creative recipe or a video editing timeline. Each step (called a "node") does one thing—like generating an image or transforming colors—and passes the result to the next step. Connect them visually, and watch your creation flow from idea to final output.

**What are AI models?** Think of them as creative assistants that have already learned specific skills. Want to generate art? There's a model for that. Transform video? There's a model. You don't train them—just pick the right assistant for your creative task.

## Step 1 — Install NodeTool

### Download and Install

1. **Download** the desktop app from [nodetool.ai](https://nodetool.ai) for your system:
   - **macOS** – Intel or Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)
   - **Windows** – Requires Windows 10 or later
   - **Linux** – AppImage or Debian package

2. **Run the installer** – it will set up everything automatically, including Python and AI engines

3. **Launch NodeTool** – on first run, choose where to install (the default location works for most people)

> **Need help?** See the detailed [Installation Guide](installation.md) for GPU requirements, troubleshooting, and platform-specific tips.

### Sign In (Optional)

- **Sign in with Supabase** to sync your workflows and assets across devices
- **Use Localhost Mode** for fully offline, private operation (`Settings → Authentication`)

### Install Your First AI Models

For the creative tutorials to work, you'll need some AI models:

1. Open **Models → Model Manager** from the top navigation
2. Install these recommended models for creators:
   - **Flux** – stunning AI image generation
   - **SDXL** – versatile image creation
   - **GPT-OSS** (optional) – for text and ideas
3. Wait for downloads to complete (~20 GB total)

> **Tip**: Don't have a powerful GPU? No problem! Skip local models and use cloud services (like OpenAI or Replicate) by adding your API key in `Settings → Providers`. You'll still create amazing things.

✅ **Checkpoint**: You should now see the NodeTool Dashboard with Templates and creative examples ready to explore.

## Step 2 — Create Your First AI Art

Let's create something visual with a pre-built template. Pick **one** of these creative options:

### Option A: Generate Movie Posters (AI Image Creation)

*Best for: Seeing AI transform ideas into stunning visuals*

1. **Find the template**: On the Dashboard, look for "Movie Posters" in the Templates panel and click it
2. **Open in Editor**: Click **Open in Editor** to see your creative canvas
3. **Understand the magic**:
   - **Input nodes** (left) – where you describe your movie
   - **AI Strategy node** (middle) – plans the visual concept
   - **Image Generator** (right) – creates the actual poster art
   - **Preview** – where your creation appears

4. **Customize your poster**: Click the input nodes and describe your movie:
   - **Title**: "Ocean Depths"
   - **Genre**: "Sci-Fi Thriller"
   - **Audience**: "Adults who love mystery"

5. **Generate**: Click the **Run** button (bottom-right) or press <kbd>Ctrl/⌘ + Enter</kbd>
6. **Watch the process**: Your poster will generate before your eyes!

**What just happened?** You gave AI a creative brief, it planned a visual strategy, then generated professional-looking poster concepts. The entire creative pipeline visible on your canvas.

### Option B: Creative Story Ideas (Idea Generation)

*Best for: Never running out of creative concepts*

1. **Find the template**: Look for "Creative Story Ideas" in Templates and open it in the Editor
2. **Understand the flow**:
   - **StringInput** nodes – your creative parameters
   - **Agent** node – AI that generates ideas
   - **Preview** – where ideas appear as they're created

3. **Set your creative direction**: Click the input nodes:
   - **Genre**: "Cyberpunk"
   - **Character**: "Rogue AI detective"
   - **Setting**: "Neon-lit underwater city"

4. **Generate ideas**: Click **Run** or press <kbd>Ctrl/⌘ + Enter</kbd>
5. **Watch creativity flow**: Ideas stream in one at a time—instant inspiration!

**What just happened?** You set creative parameters and AI generated dozens of unique story concepts. Perfect for brainstorming, overcoming creative blocks, or starting new projects.

✅ **Checkpoint**: You've created your first AI-generated content! The results appeared right in your workflow canvas.

## Step 3 — Experiment and Make It Yours

Now let's personalize your workflow and see how easy it is to iterate.

1. **Save your workflow**: Press <kbd>Ctrl/⌘ + S</kbd> or use `File → Save`. Give it a creative name like "My Poster Generator"

2. **Try different inputs**: Go back and change your creative parameters:
   - Different movie titles, genres, or audiences for posters
   - New story settings and characters for ideas
   
3. **Run again**: Each time you click Run, you get fresh, unique results

4. **Explore the canvas**: Try these creative experiments:
   - Click any node to see its settings
   - Hover over connections to see what data flows through
   - Click Preview nodes to see results at any stage

**Why is this powerful?** Unlike traditional tools where you make one thing at a time, NodeTool lets you create variations instantly. Generate dozens of concepts in seconds, pick the best ones, refine them. It's like having a creative studio that never gets tired.

✅ **Checkpoint**: You've learned to customize and iterate—the core of creative AI workflows.

## Step 4 — Share Your Creative Tool

Turn your workflow into a simple app that anyone can use—no NodeTool knowledge required.

1. **Open your workflow** in the editor
2. **Click Mini-App** in the top-right corner
3. **See the simplified view**: You'll see a clean interface with just the creative inputs and outputs
4. **Share it**: Perfect for clients, collaborators, or anyone who just wants to create—without seeing the technical pipeline

**What just happened?** NodeTool generated a user-friendly interface from your workflow. The same AI pipeline runs underneath, but users see only what they need: inputs to customize and results to enjoy. Like sharing a Photoshop action as a one-click filter.

✅ **Checkpoint**: You now have **three ways** to create: Visual Editor (full control), Chat (conversational), and Mini-App (simplified for anyone).
