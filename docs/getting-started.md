Getting Started

Welcome to **NodeTool**! This quick guide shows you how to build your first workflow and discover some handy tips along
the way.

## 1. Install NodeTool

If you haven't already, grab the latest release from [nodetool.ai](https://nodetool.ai) and run the installer. Check out
[Installing NodeTool](installation.md) for full details.

## 2. Install Models

Open NodeTool, which will start up the server and show a setup screen.

1. The screen shows download links for models. We recommend GPT - OSS to enable agentic workflows and Flux for image
   generation. Ensure 20GB+ free disk space.
1. Optional: Use cloud providers. Open Settings to add API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, Gemini), and install
   Packs like Replicate, Fal.ai, or ElevenLabs from the Packs menu.

Tip: Your data stays local unless you explicitly use cloud providers. You can also use the "Recommended Models" button
on compatible nodes to quickly pick the right model.

## 3. Create a Workflow

1. Click **New Workflow** or click on **Templates** to browse through helpful workflows.
1. Open the NodeMenu with the **Space Key** or double click the canvas. To find nodes, browse the namespaces on the left
   or use the search.
1. Right-click the Canvas and create a String Input node. Enter a value.
1. Now drag a connection from the output and drop it on the canvase. A menu pops up and select "Create Preview Node"
1. Hit the **Play Button in the bottom right corner** or press (<kbd>Ctrl + Enter</kbd> | <kbd>âŒ˜ + Enter</kbd>) to run
   the workflow.

## 4. Explore More Features

- **Use local models** for maximum privacy or connect to cloud providers when you need extra power.
- **Index your own documents** and ask questions about them with Retrieval-Augmented Generation.
- **Run any node or workflow from the chat** and use any support LLM locally or from a cloud provider.
