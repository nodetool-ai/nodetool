## Workflow Canvas – Your Creative Studio

This is where you build creative AI workflows visually—think of it as your canvas for connecting creative ideas.

### The Canvas

The large center area is your **infinite canvas** – like an endless artboard where you arrange your creative process.

**Moving Around:**
- **Pan** (scroll the view): Hold `Space` and drag, or right-click and drag (like navigating in Photoshop)
- **Zoom**: `Ctrl/⌘` + scroll wheel (like pinch-to-zoom)
- **Fit everything**: Press `F` (frame all, like in design tools)

### Adding Creative Nodes

Nodes are your creative building blocks—like tools in a toolbox. To add one:

1. Press `Space` anywhere on canvas, **OR**
2. Double-click an empty area

This opens the **Node Library** where you can:
- **Search** by typing what you want (e.g., "generate image", "transform video")
- **Browse** categories on the left (Image, Video, Audio, Text)
- **Click** a node to add it to your canvas

**Think of it like:** Adding a new layer in Photoshop or a new track in a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).

### Connecting Your Creative Flow

Connections show how your creative work flows between nodes:

1. Find the small **circles** on nodes (outputs on right, inputs on left)
2. **Click and drag** from an output circle
3. **Release** on an input circle of another node

> **Pro tip**: Drop a connection on empty space to see compatible nodes—NodeTool suggests what can connect!

**Think of it like:** Connecting effect pedals in a music setup, or routing layers in After Effects.

### The Properties Panel

When you select a node, the right panel shows its **creative controls** (like adjustment sliders in Lightroom):

- **Inputs** – What the node needs (text, images, etc.)
- **Settings** – Configuration options
- **Output** – What the node produces

---

## Global Chat

Global Chat is your AI assistant built into NodeTool.

### What You Can Do

- **Chat** with AI models about anything
- **Run workflows** directly from conversation
- **Enable Agent Mode** to let AI build and modify workflows
- **Share files** – images, audio, documents

### Chat Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Threads** | Multiple conversations, each with its own history |
| **Model Selector** | Choose which AI model to chat with |
| **Workflow Menu** | Attach and run your saved workflows |
| **Agent Mode** | Let the AI use tools and modify your canvas |

---

## Mini-Apps

### Why Use Mini-Apps?

- **Hide complexity** – Users see only inputs and outputs
- **Share easily** – No NodeTool knowledge required

### How It Works
