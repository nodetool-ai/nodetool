NodeTool lets you store and organise files used in your workflows. Assets can be images, audio clips, PDFs or any other resources referenced by nodes.

### Browsing assets

- Use the **Asset Explorer** to navigate folders and upload new files.
- Switch between grid or table views to inspect metadata.
- Preview common formats directly in the editor with the built‑in viewers.

Drag any asset directly from the Asset Explorer into a workflow to create the corresponding input node automatically.

Large asset libraries use infinite scrolling and virtualization for performance. Switch between grid/table view
depending on the dataset size.

### Metadata and tags

- Assets keep track of basic metadata like size and type.
- Tag files to make searching easier when projects grow large.

### Document indexing

- Text‑based files can be indexed for vector search.
- Combine the index with language models for Retrieval‑Augmented Generation.

Assets are stored locally in your user directory so you keep full control of your data.

Assets can be grouped into Collections for RAG workflows. Create a collection from the left panel and drag items into it.

Audio, PDF, video, and text files have specialized viewers. Use the toolbar in the viewer to zoom, scrub, or copy text
excerpts.
