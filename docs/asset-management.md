NodeTool lets you store and organise files used in your workflows. Assets can be images, audio clips, PDFs or any other resources referenced by nodes.

### Browsing assets

- Use the **Asset Explorer** to navigate folders and upload new files.
- Switch between grid or table views to inspect metadata.
- Preview common formats directly in the editor with the built‑in viewers.

### Metadata and tags

- Assets keep track of basic metadata like size and type.
- Tag files to make searching easier when projects grow large.

### Document indexing

- Text‑based files can be indexed for vector search.
- Combine the index with language models for Retrieval‑Augmented Generation.

Assets are stored locally in your user directory so you keep full control of your data.
