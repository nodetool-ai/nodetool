## layout: default title: Node Packs

Node Packs extend NodeTool with additional nodes and integrations. Packs are distributed through the public registry and
can be installed directly from the app.

### Finding packs

Install and manage packs directly from the desktop app.

- Open Package Manager: Launch the Electron desktop app, then open the Package Manager from the Tools menu.
- Browse and search packages: Use the top search box to filter by package name, description, or repo id.
- Search nodes across packs: Use the “Search nodes” field to find nodes by title, description, or type. You can install
  the required pack directly from node results.

### Installing or removing packs

- Click **Install** to add a pack. The pack will be installed as a pip package.
- Use **Uninstall** to remove a pack you no longer need.
- Packs can also be updated from the same screen when new versions are released.

### Command line alternative

If you prefer the terminal, run `nodetool package list -a` to see every pack. Install one with
`pip install git+https://github.com/nodetool-ai/<pack-name>`. Advanced users can manage versions this way.

### Publishing your own pack

The NodeTool Packs Registry on GitHub explains how to create and publish packs. Following those guidelines lets others
discover and install your work easily.
