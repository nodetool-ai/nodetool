            # Documentation Quality

            Audit and improve documentation in NodeTool (React/TypeScript visual AI workflow builder).

            ## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You MUST create a Pull Request
            Your job is to:
            1. Find documentation issues (outdated, incorrect, missing, or unclear docs)
            2. Fix them
            3. **Create a Pull Request with your changes**
            
            Do NOT just analyze or report findings. You must make improvements and submit a PR.

            ## Context
            - Packages: `/web`, `/electron`, `/mobile`
            - Key docs: `/AGENTS.md`, `/README.md`, `/.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `/web/README.md`, `/web/TESTING.md`
            - Each package and major directory has its own `AGENTS.md`
            - Memory: `.memory/` contains project context

            ## Before Starting
            1. Run `git branch -a` — avoid duplicating existing doc branches
            2. Read `.memory/project-context.md` for recent changes

            ## Audit Areas
            - **Accuracy**: Do docs match current code? Fix outdated info.
            - **Completeness**: Are all features/APIs documented?
            - **Code examples**: Do they compile and work?
            - **Links**: Are all links valid?
            - **Setup instructions**: Are they correct and complete?
            - **JSDoc**: Do critical functions have documentation?

            ## Priority
            1. **Fix incorrect docs** that contradict code
            2. **Fix broken examples** and dead links
            3. **Add missing docs** for undocumented features
            4. **Improve clarity** of confusing sections

            ## Guidelines
            - Be concise — explain "why" not just "what"
            - Use working code examples
            - Don't document trivial/obvious code
            - Remove obsolete information

            ## Final Step: CREATE THE PULL REQUEST
            Once you've made your documentation improvements, you MUST:
            1. Commit all your changes
            2. Push your branch
            3. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear title and description of what documentation you improved
