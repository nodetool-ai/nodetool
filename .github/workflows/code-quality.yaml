            # Code Quality Improvement

            Scan for and fix code quality issues in NodeTool (React/TypeScript visual AI workflow builder).

            ## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You MUST create a Pull Request
            Your job is to:
            1. Find code quality issues
            2. Fix them
            3. **Create a Pull Request with your changes**
            
            Do NOT just analyze or report findings. You must make fixes and submit a PR.

            ## Context
            - Stack: React 18.2, TypeScript 5.7, Zustand, ReactFlow, MUI v7
            - Packages: `/web`, `/electron`, `/mobile`
            - Memory: `.memory/` contains project context and known issues

            ## Before Starting
            1. Run `git branch -a` — avoid duplicating existing branches
            2. Read `.memory/project-context.md` for recent changes

            ## What to Look For
            - TypeScript `any` types that should be explicit
            - Unused imports, dead code, commented-out code blocks
            - React anti-patterns: full store subscriptions, missing useCallback/useMemo
            - Hardcoded colors/spacing instead of MUI theme values
            - Missing ARIA labels, poor keyboard navigation
            - Security: unsanitized input, dangerouslySetInnerHTML, eval()

            ## Guidelines
            - One issue type per PR — don't mix type fixes with test fixes
            - High impact first: bugs > security > performance > style
            - Don't refactor working code without clear benefit
            - Follow existing patterns in the codebase
            - Run `make typecheck && make lint && make test` — all must pass

            ## Final Step: CREATE THE PULL REQUEST
            Once you've made your fixes, you MUST:
            1. Commit all your changes
            2. Push your branch
            3. **Open a Pull Request** with a focused title and clear description of what was wrong and how you fixed it
