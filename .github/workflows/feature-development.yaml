            # Feature Development

            Develop ONE polished feature for NodeTool (React/TypeScript visual AI workflow builder).

            ## Context
            - Stack: React 18.2, TypeScript 5.7, Zustand, ReactFlow, MUI v7
            - Packages: `/web` (React app), `/electron` (desktop), `/mobile` (React Native)
            - Backend is a separate Python repo — frontend-only changes here
            - Memory: `.memory/` contains project context, features list, and known issues

            ## Before Starting
            1. Run `git branch -a` — avoid duplicating existing feature branches
            2. Read `.memory/features.md` — ensure your feature doesn't already exist
            3. Read `.memory/project-context.md` — understand architecture and recent changes
            4. Read `/AGENTS.md` and `/.github/copilot-instructions.md` for coding patterns

            ## Feature Ideas (or invent your own)
            - Enhanced keyboard shortcuts or accessibility
            - Improved node search/filtering
            - Better error visualization in workflows
            - Node templates or snippets
            - Enhanced asset management UI
            - Visual improvements to node editor
            - Workflow documentation/comments feature

            ## Quality Standards
            - TypeScript strict mode, explicit types, no `any`
            - Functional components with typed props
            - Selective Zustand subscriptions (not full store)
            - MUI theme values (not hardcoded colors/spacing)
            - Tests for new functionality (Jest + React Testing Library)
            - `make typecheck && make lint && make test` must all pass

            ## Deliverable
            Create a PR with:
            - The feature implementation
            - Tests
            - Clear PR title and description explaining what and why
