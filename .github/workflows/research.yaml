            # Research & Prototyping

            Explore and prototype an experimental feature for NodeTool (React/TypeScript visual AI workflow builder).

            ## Context
            - Stack: React 18.2, TypeScript 5.7, Zustand, ReactFlow, MUI v7
            - Packages: `/web`, `/electron`, `/mobile`
            - Frontend-only repo — backend is separate Python repo
            - Memory: `.memory/` contains project context and feature list

            ## Before Starting
            1. Run `git branch -a` — avoid duplicating existing research branches
            2. Read `.memory/features.md` — ensure your idea doesn't already exist
            3. Read `.memory/project-context.md` — understand architecture

            ## Research Areas
            - AI-assisted workflow generation or smart node recommendations
            - Visual debugging and breakpoints for workflows
            - Workflow version diffing
            - Advanced node grouping/nesting
            - Real-time data flow visualization
            - Plugin system for custom nodes
            - Collaborative editing capabilities
            - Privacy-preserving workflow sharing

            ## Evaluation Criteria
            - **Feasible** with frontend-only changes?
            - **Impactful** for users/developers/researchers?
            - **Aligned** with visual-first, privacy-first philosophy?
            - **Performant** at scale?

            ## Approach
            1. Start with smallest useful version (MVP)
            2. Follow existing code patterns
            3. Mark experimental features clearly
            4. `make typecheck && make lint && make test` must all pass

            ## Deliverable
            Create a PR with:
            - The prototype implementation
            - Brief description of what was explored, findings, and next steps
