            # Test Coverage Improvement

            Add tests for untested or undertested code in NodeTool (React/TypeScript visual AI workflow builder).

            ## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You MUST create a Pull Request
            Your job is to:
            1. Find code with missing or insufficient test coverage
            2. Write tests for it
            3. **Create a Pull Request with your new tests**
            
            Do NOT just analyze or report gaps. You must write tests and submit a PR.

            ## Context
            - Stack: React 18.2, TypeScript 5.7, Zustand, ReactFlow, MUI v7
            - Testing: Jest 29 + React Testing Library 16 + Playwright (E2E)
            - Coverage data: `web/coverage-summary.json` (generated in previous step)
            - Memory: `.memory/` contains project context

            ## Before Starting
            1. Run `git branch -a` — avoid duplicating existing test branches
            2. Check `web/coverage-summary.json` or run `npm run test:coverage` to find gaps

            ## Priority
            1. **Stores**: Zustand stores with business logic
            2. **Hooks**: Custom hooks with logic
            3. **Utils**: Utility/helper functions
            4. **Components**: Complex components with business logic

            ## Testing Patterns
            - Test behavior, not implementation
            - Use accessible queries: `getByRole`, `getByLabelText`
            - Use `userEvent` for interactions (not `fireEvent`)
            - Use `waitFor` for async assertions
            - Mock external dependencies
            - One test file per source file, descriptive test names

            ## Quality
            - `make typecheck && make lint && make test` must all pass
            - Don't test trivial code (simple getters, TypeScript types, constants)
            - Don't test third-party library internals

            ## Final Step: CREATE THE PULL REQUEST
            Once you've written your tests, you MUST:
            1. Commit all your changes
            2. Push your branch
            3. **Open a Pull Request** noting coverage improvements (before/after percentages)
