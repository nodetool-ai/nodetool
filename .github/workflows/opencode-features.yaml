            Read the docs and code to understand Nodetool.
            Think about one exciting feature to add.
            It can be a small nice feature or something really crazy.
            It should follow the principles in the docs.
            If you find anything worth addressing, submit a coherent PR to fix it.
            make lint, make test and make typecheck have to pass.
