### Security Vulnerability Fixes (2026-01-18)

**Vulnerabilities Fixed**:
- glob Command Injection (GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2) - Added npm override in electron/package.json, fixed via npm audit fix in web and mobile
- tar Arbitrary File Overwrite (GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97) - Fixed via npm audit fix in mobile package

**Severity**: High

**Impact**: Command injection via glob CLI could allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands. Arbitrary file overwrite via tar could allow attackers to write files outside intended directories.

**Solution**:
- Added `"glob": ">=10.5.1"` override in electron/package.json
- Ran `npm audit fix` in web and mobile packages to update vulnerable dependencies
- Removed 7 packages and changed 5 in web package
- Removed vulnerable tar versions in mobile package

**Files Modified**:
- `electron/package.json` - Added glob override
- `web/package.json` - Updated via npm audit fix
- `mobile/package.json` - Updated via npm audit fix

**Verification**:
- `make lint` - PASS (0 errors, 10 warnings)
- `npm audit web` - Reduced from 10 vulnerabilities (1 high) to 8 (all low severity)
- `npm audit mobile` - Reduced from 10 vulnerabilities (2 high) to 8 (1 high, 7 moderate)
- `npm audit electron` - glob vulnerability fixed, remaining 21 require breaking changes

**Remaining Issues**:
- **Electron**: 21 vulnerabilities (6 high) in electron-builder and tar dependencies require downgrading to electron-builder 23.0.6 (breaking change)
- **Mobile**: 1 high severity vulnerability in prismjs (via react-native-syntax-highlighter) has no fix available
- **Mobile**: 7 moderate severity vulnerabilities in highlight.js and markdown-it have no fix available

**Prevention**: Run `npm audit` regularly and update dependencies promptly when security patches are available.

### Security Vulnerability Fixes (2026-01-12)

**Vulnerabilities Fixed**:
- DOMPurify XSS (CVE-2024-XXXX) - Updated from 3.2.3 to 3.2.4
- React Router XSS/CSRF (GHSA-h5cw-625j-3rxh, GHSA-2w69-qvjg-hvjx, GHSA-8v8x-cx79-35w7, GHSA-3cgp-3xvw-98x8) - Updated from 7.6.0 to 7.12.0
- React Syntax Highlighter XSS (GHSA-x7hr-w5r2-h6wg) - Updated from 15.6.1 to 16.1.0
- Express/Qs DoS (GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p) - Added overrides in electron/package.json
- Missing Content Security Policy - Added CSP meta tag to web/index.html

**Severity**: Critical/High

**Impact**: User data and API keys could be compromised through XSS attacks in workflow names, chat messages, and rendered content. DoS attacks possible through malicious query parameters.

**Solution**:
- Updated direct dependencies to patched versions
- Added npm overrides for transitive dependencies in electron package
- Implemented Content Security Policy to mitigate XSS attacks

**Files Modified**:
- `web/package.json` - Updated dompurify, react-router-dom, react-syntax-highlighter
- `electron/package.json` - Added overrides for qs, express, body-parser
- `web/index.html` - Added CSP meta tag

**Verification**:
- `make typecheck` - PASS
- `make lint` - PASS
- `npm audit web` - Reduced from 8 vulnerabilities (2 high) to 2 (1 high, 1 low)
- `npm audit electron` - Reduced from 12 vulnerabilities (3 high) to 0

**Note**: Remaining 2 web vulnerabilities are in transitive dependencies (glob via esbuild-style-plugin, @eslint/plugin-kit via eslint) that require upstream fixes.

**Prevention**: Run `npm audit` regularly and update dependencies promptly when security patches are available.
