### Security Vulnerability Fixes (2026-01-17)

**Second Audit (2026-01-17)**:
- **tar vulnerability (CVE-2026-23745)**: Updated tar from ^7.4.3 to ^7.5.3 in electron/package.json
- **glob vulnerability**: Added override for glob >=10.5.0 in web/package.json
- **Mobile tar/undici**: Added overrides in mobile/package.json for tar >=7.5.3 and undici >=6.23.0

**Vulnerabilities Mitigated**:
- Web: 1 HIGH (glob via esbuild-style-plugin) - pending fix via override
- Electron: 1 HIGH (tar direct) - FIXED by updating to 7.5.3
- Mobile: 1 HIGH (tar), 1 LOW (undici) - pending fix via overrides

**Known Issues (Cannot be easily fixed)**:
- Electron: Nested tar@6.2.1 in electron-builder dependencies - requires electron-builder update
- Mobile: prismjs XSS vulnerabilities in react-native-syntax-highlighter - no fix available

**Code Security Audit Results**:
- No hardcoded secrets found (properly uses environment variables and API client)
- XSS protection properly implemented (DOMPurify, escapeHtml functions)
- No dangerous patterns (eval, nodeIntegration: true) found
- Electron security best practices followed (contextIsolation: true, sandbox: true)

**Verification**:
- Lint: PASS (10 warnings, 0 errors)
- TypeScript: Pre-existing test file issues (not caused by security changes)

### Security Vulnerability Fixes (2026-01-12)

**Vulnerabilities Fixed**:
- DOMPurify XSS (CVE-2024-XXXX) - Updated from 3.2.3 to 3.2.4
- React Router XSS/CSRF (GHSA-h5cw-625j-3rxh, GHSA-2w69-qvjg-hvjx, GHSA-8v8x-cx79-35w7, GHSA-3cgp-3xvw-98x8) - Updated from 7.6.0 to 7.12.0
- React Syntax Highlighter XSS (GHSA-x7hr-w5r2-h6wg) - Updated from 15.6.1 to 16.1.0
- Express/Qs DoS (GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p) - Added overrides in electron/package.json
- Missing Content Security Policy - Added CSP meta tag to web/index.html

**Severity**: Critical/High

**Impact**: User data and API keys could be compromised through XSS attacks in workflow names, chat messages, and rendered content. DoS attacks possible through malicious query parameters.

**Solution**:
- Updated direct dependencies to patched versions
- Added npm overrides for transitive dependencies in electron package
- Implemented Content Security Policy to mitigate XSS attacks

**Files Modified**:
- `web/package.json` - Updated dompurify, react-router-dom, react-syntax-highlighter
- `electron/package.json` - Added overrides for qs, express, body-parser
- `web/index.html` - Added CSP meta tag

**Verification**:
- `make typecheck` - PASS
- `make lint` - PASS
- `npm audit web` - Reduced from 8 vulnerabilities (2 high) to 2 (1 high, 1 low)
- `npm audit electron` - Reduced from 12 vulnerabilities (3 high) to 0

**Note**: Remaining 2 web vulnerabilities are in transitive dependencies (glob via esbuild-style-plugin, @eslint/plugin-kit via eslint) that require upstream fixes.

**Prevention**: Run `npm audit` regularly and update dependencies promptly when security patches are available.
