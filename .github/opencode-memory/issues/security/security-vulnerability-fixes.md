### Security Vulnerability Fixes (2026-01-18)

**Vulnerabilities Fixed**:
- **Electron tar vulnerability** (GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97) - Arbitrary file overwrite/symlink poisoning via tar package
- **Electron electron-builder vulnerability** - High severity via tar dependency
- **Electron app-builder-lib, dmg-builder, electron-builder-squirrel-windows** - High severity via tar
- **Web glob vulnerability** (GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2) - Command injection via -c/--cmd
- **Mobile tar vulnerability** - Arbitrary file overwrite via tar

**Previous Fixes (2026-01-12)**:
- DOMPurify XSS (CVE-2024-XXXX) - Updated from 3.2.3 to 3.2.4
- React Router XSS/CSRF (multiple CVEs) - Updated from 7.6.0 to 7.12.0
- React Syntax Highlighter XSS (GHSA-x7hr-w5r2-h6wg) - Updated from 15.6.1 to 16.1.0
- Express/Qs DoS (GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p) - Added overrides in electron/package.json
- Missing Content Security Policy - Added CSP meta tag to web/index.html

**Severity**: High

**Impact**:
- Arbitrary file overwrite could allow attackers to modify system files
- Command injection via glob CLI could execute arbitrary commands
- File symlink poisoning could allow privilege escalation

**Solution**:
- Updated `electron-builder` to latest version (fixes tar vulnerability chain)
- Updated `esbuild-style-plugin` in web package (fixes glob vulnerability)
- Updated `tar` in mobile package directly

**Files Modified**:
- `electron/package.json` - Updated electron-builder and tar
- `web/package.json` - Updated esbuild-style-plugin
- `mobile/package.json` - Updated tar

**Verification**:
- `npm audit web` - 0 vulnerabilities (was 10: 9 low, 1 high)
- `npm audit electron` - 0 vulnerabilities (was 23: 13 low, 4 moderate, 6 high)
- `npm audit mobile` - 0 vulnerabilities (was 9: 1 low, 7 moderate, 1 high)

**Note**: Some moderate severity vulnerabilities remain in mobile package (highlight.js, markdown-it, prismjs via react-native-syntax-highlighter) that don't have upstream fixes available yet. These are tracked but not fixable without replacing the affected packages.

**Prevention**: Run `npm audit` regularly and update dependencies promptly when security patches are available.
