### Security Vulnerability Fixes (2026-01-19)

**Vulnerabilities Fixed**:
- glob Command Injection (GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2) - Added override for glob >=10.5.0 in web/package.json
- tar Arbitrary File Overwrite/Symlink Poisoning (GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97) - Updated tar from ^7.4.3 to ^7.5.3 in electron/package.json, added override >=7.5.3 in mobile/package.json

**Severity**: High

**Impact**: 
- glob vulnerability allows command injection via -c/--cmd flag in glob CLI
- tar vulnerability allows arbitrary file overwrite and symlink poisoning

**Solution**:
- Added npm overrides for transitive dependencies to force patched versions
- Updated tar direct dependency to latest secure version

**Files Modified**:
- `web/package.json` - Added glob override >=10.5.0
- `electron/package.json` - Updated tar to ^7.5.3
- `mobile/package.json` - Added tar override >=7.5.3

**Verification**:
- `make typecheck` - PASS
- `make lint` - PASS
- `npm audit web` - Reduced from 10 vulnerabilities (1 high) to 9 (0 high, 4 moderate, 5 low)
- `npm audit electron` - Reduced from 23 vulnerabilities (6 high) to 9 (0 high, 4 moderate, 5 low)
- `npm audit mobile` - Reduced from 10 vulnerabilities (2 high) to 0

**Note**: Remaining vulnerabilities are in transitive dependencies that require upstream fixes or are low severity.

**Prevention**: Run `npm audit` regularly and use overrides to patch transitive dependencies.

### Security Vulnerability Fixes (2026-01-12)

**Vulnerabilities Fixed**:
- DOMPurify XSS (CVE-2024-XXXX) - Updated from 3.2.3 to 3.2.4
- React Router XSS/CSRF (GHSA-h5cw-625j-3rxh, GHSA-2w69-qvjg-hvjx, GHSA-8v8x-cx79-35w7, GHSA-3cgp-3xvw-98x8) - Updated from 7.6.0 to 7.12.0
- React Syntax Highlighter XSS (GHSA-x7hr-w5r2-h6wg) - Updated from 15.6.1 to 16.1.0
- Express/Qs DoS (GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p) - Added overrides in electron/package.json
- Missing Content Security Policy - Added CSP meta tag to web/index.html

**Severity**: Critical/High

**Impact**: User data and API keys could be compromised through XSS attacks in workflow names, chat messages, and rendered content. DoS attacks possible through malicious query parameters.

**Solution**:
- Updated direct dependencies to patched versions
- Added npm overrides for transitive dependencies in electron package
- Implemented Content Security Policy to mitigate XSS attacks

**Files Modified**:
- `web/package.json` - Updated dompurify, react-router-dom, react-syntax-highlighter
- `electron/package.json` - Added overrides for qs, express, body-parser
- `web/index.html` - Added CSP meta tag

**Verification**:
- `make typecheck` - PASS
- `make lint` - PASS
- `npm audit web` - Reduced from 8 vulnerabilities (2 high) to 2 (1 high, 1 low)
- `npm audit electron` - Reduced from 12 vulnerabilities (3 high) to 0

**Note**: Remaining 2 web vulnerabilities are in transitive dependencies (glob via esbuild-style-plugin, @eslint/plugin-kit via eslint) that require upstream fixes.

**Prevention**: Run `npm audit` regularly and update dependencies promptly when security patches are available.
