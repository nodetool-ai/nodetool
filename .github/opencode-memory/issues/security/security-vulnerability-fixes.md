### Security Vulnerability Fixes (2026-01-19)

**Vulnerabilities Fixed**:
- glob Command Injection (GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2) - Added override in web/package.json for glob >= 10.5.0
- tar Arbitrary File Overwrite (GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97) - Updated tar to ^7.5.3 in electron/package.json and mobile/package.json

**Severity**: High

**Impact**: Command injection and arbitrary file overwrite vulnerabilities could allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands or overwrite sensitive files.

**Solution**:
- Added npm overrides for glob and tar to force patched versions
- Updated direct tar dependency to secure version

**Files Modified**:
- `web/package.json` - Added override for glob
- `electron/package.json` - Updated tar dependency and added override
- `mobile/package.json` - Added overrides for tar and prismjs

**Verification**:
- `npm audit web` - Reduced from 1 high severity to 0 high severity (9 low remain)
- `npm audit electron` - Reduced from 6 high severity to 0 high severity (15 vulnerabilities remain: 10 low, 5 moderate)
- `npm audit mobile` - Fixed tar high vulnerability (2 high remain in react-native-syntax-highlighter)

**Note**: Mobile package has 2 remaining high severity vulnerabilities in react-native-syntax-highlighter (prismjs XSS, highlight.js ReDoS) with no fix available. This requires either library replacement or accepting the risk.
