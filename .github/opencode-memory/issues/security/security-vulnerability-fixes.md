### Additional Security Fixes (2026-01-18)

**Vulnerabilities Fixed**:

**Web Package**:
- glob CLI Command Injection (GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2, HIGH) - Added override for glob>=10.5.0
- Result: Reduced from 10 vulnerabilities (1 high) to 0

**Electron Package**:
- electron-builder Update - Updated from 26.3.4 to 26.4.1
- Added overrides for glob>=10.5.0
- Runtime tar version updated to ^7.4.3 (safe)
- Note: electron-builder's transitive dependencies still have some dev-only vulnerabilities requiring future migration

**Mobile Package**:
- tar Arbitrary File Overwrite (GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97, HIGH) - Added override for tar>=7.4.3
- undici DoS (GHSA-g9mf-h72j-4rw9, LOW) - Added override for undici>=6.23.0
- Result: Reduced from 10 vulnerabilities (2 high) to 0

**Security Best Practices Applied**:
1. npm overrides for transitive dependencies in all packages
2. CSP headers properly configured in web/index.html
3. Electron context isolation and nodeIntegration disabled
4. DOMPurify used for all dangerouslySetInnerHTML cases
5. escapeHtml utility for workflow name sanitization

**Files Modified**:
- `web/package.json` - Added glob override
- `electron/package.json` - Updated electron-builder, added glob override
- `mobile/package.json` - Added tar and undici overrides

**Verification**:
- `make lint` - PASS (only warnings)
- `npm audit web` - 0 vulnerabilities
- `npm audit electron` - 21 vulnerabilities (all in dev dependencies, runtime safe)
- `npm audit mobile` - 0 vulnerabilities

**Known Issues (Dev-Only)**:
- electron-builder 26.x still has tar vulnerability in transitive deps (requires major version change to fix)
- esbuild in electron fuse dependency has moderate vulnerability (dev-only)
