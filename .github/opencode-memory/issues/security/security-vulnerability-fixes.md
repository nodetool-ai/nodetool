### Security Vulnerability Fixes (2026-01-17)

**Vulnerabilities Fixed**:
- glob Command Injection (GHSA-5j98-mcp5-4vw2) - Added override in web/package.json for glob >=10.5.0

**Severity**: High

**Impact**: Command injection via glob CLI with -c/--cmd option could allow arbitrary code execution.

**Solution**:
- Added npm override for glob in web/package.json: `"glob": "^10.5.0"`

**Files Modified**:
- `web/package.json` - Added glob override
- `web/package-lock.json` - Regenerated

**Verification**:
- `npm audit web` - Reduced from 10 vulnerabilities (1 high, 9 low) to 0 (production)
- All remaining vulnerabilities are low severity in dev dependencies

**Known Issues (Require Upstream Fixes)**:
- Electron: tar vulnerability (GHSA-8qq5-rm4j-mr97) in @electron/rebuild and app-builder-lib - requires electron-builder downgrade or upstream patch
- Mobile: tar vulnerability in @expo/cli transitive dependency - requires Expo update
- Mobile: prismjs XSS vulnerabilities (multiple CVEs) in react-native-syntax-highlighter - no fix available

**Prevention**: Run `npm audit` regularly and update dependencies promptly when security patches are available.

### Security Vulnerability Fixes (2026-01-12)

**Vulnerabilities Fixed**:
- DOMPurify XSS (CVE-2024-XXXX) - Updated from 3.2.3 to 3.2.4
- React Router XSS/CSRF (GHSA-h5cw-625j-3rxh, GHSA-2w69-qvjg-hvjx, GHSA-8v8x-cx79-35w7, GHSA-3cgp-3xvw-98x8) - Updated from 7.6.0 to 7.12.0
- React Syntax Highlighter XSS (GHSA-x7hr-w5r2-h6wg) - Updated from 15.6.1 to 16.1.0
- Express/Qs DoS (GHSA-6rw7-vpxm-498p) - Added overrides in electron/package.json
- Missing Content Security Policy - Added CSP meta tag to web/index.html

**Severity**: Critical/High

**Impact**: User data and API keys could be compromised through XSS attacks in workflow names, chat messages, and rendered content. DoS attacks possible through malicious query parameters.

**Solution**:
- Updated direct dependencies to patched versions
- Added npm overrides for transitive dependencies in electron package
- Implemented Content Security Policy to mitigate XSS attacks

**Files Modified**:
- `web/package.json` - Updated dompurify, react-router-dom, react-syntax-highlighter
- `electron/package.json` - Added overrides for qs, express, body-parser
- `web/index.html` - Added CSP meta tag

**Verification**:
- `make typecheck` - PASS
- `make lint` - PASS
- `npm audit web` - Reduced from 8 vulnerabilities (2 high) to 2 (1 high, 1 low)
- `npm audit electron` - Reduced from 12 vulnerabilities (3 high) to 0

**Note**: Remaining 2 web vulnerabilities are in transitive dependencies (glob via esbuild-style-plugin, @eslint/plugin-kit via eslint) that require upstream fixes.

**Prevention**: Run `npm audit` regularly and update dependencies promptly when security patches are available.
