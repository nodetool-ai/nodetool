# Quality Checks Fix (2026-01-14)

**Problem**: Mobile package type checking was failing due to missing type definitions for 'jest', 'node', and 'react-native'. The web test file had unused variable warnings.

**Solution**: Ran `npm install` in the mobile package to ensure dependencies were installed. Removed unused `formatDuration` function from `NodeExecutionTime.test.tsx`.

**Files**:
- `mobile/package.json` - Already had type definitions but needed install
- `web/src/components/node/__tests__/NodeExecutionTime.test.tsx` - Removed unused variable
