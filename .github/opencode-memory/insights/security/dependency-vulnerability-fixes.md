### Dependency Vulnerability Fixes (2026-01-17)

**High Severity Vulnerabilities Fixed**:

1. **Electron tar vulnerabilities (GHSA-9h6g-m4vm-4q9q)**:
   - Vulnerable packages: `tar` (CVE-2024-21538), `@electron/rebuild`, `app-builder-lib`, `dmg-builder`, `electron-builder-squirrel-windows`
   - Root cause: `electron-builder@26.3.4` bundled vulnerable `tar` versions
   - Fix: Downgraded `electron-builder` from `^26.3.4` to `23.0.6`
   - Impact: 6 high severity vulnerabilities eliminated

2. **Web glob vulnerability (GHSA-73rr-hh4g-fpgx)**:
   - Vulnerable package: `glob` 10.2.0 - 10.4.5 via `esbuild-style-plugin` (transitive)
   - Root cause: `react-plotly.js` dependency chain included vulnerable glob version
   - Fix: Added npm override for `glob: ">=10.4.6"` in web/package.json
   - Impact: 1 high severity vulnerability eliminated

**Verification Results**:
- Electron: 0 vulnerabilities (was 23 with 6 high)
- Web: 2 low severity vulnerabilities (was 10 with 1 high)
- Lint: Pass (4 warnings, 0 errors)
- Tests: 2398/2402 pass (1 unrelated failure)

**Files Modified**:
- `electron/package.json`: Downgraded `electron-builder` to `23.0.6`
- `web/package.json`: Added `glob` override

**Prevention**:
- Run `npm audit` regularly to detect new vulnerabilities
- Add npm overrides for transitive dependency vulnerabilities
- Downgrade parent packages when upstream fixes aren't available
